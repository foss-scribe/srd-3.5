EPIC MAGIC ITEMS 1





While not truly an artifact, the epic magic item is a creation of such power that it surpasses other magic items.Epic magic items are objects of great power and value. The following are typical characteristics of an epic magic item. In general, an item with even one of these characteristics is an epic magic item.

•Grants a bonus on attacks or damage greater than +5.

•Grants an enhancement bonus to armor higher than +5.

•Has a special ability with a market price modifier greater than +5.

•Grants an armor bonus of greater than +10 (not including magic armor’s enhancement bonus).

•Grants a natural armor, deflection, or resistance bonus greater than +5.

•Grants an enhancement bonus to an ability score greater than +6.

•Grants an enhancement bonus on a skill check greater than +30.

•Mimics a spell of an effective level higher than 9th.

•Has a caster level above 20th.

•Has a market price above 200,000 gp, not including material costs for armor or weapons, material component- or experience point-based costs, or additional value for intelligent items.

An epic magic item that grants a bonus beyond those allowed for normal magic itemshas a higher market price than indicated by the formulas for non-epic items.

Epic magic items are not artifacts. They are not unique, though they are certainly very rare, and anyone with the proper item creation feats can build them. Even an epic magic item can never grant a dodge bonus, and the maximum inherent bonus that can be applied to an ability score is +5. An epic magic item cannot be created that uses or mimics an epic spell. A major artifact might be able to mimic such a spell, however.





### CREATING EPIC MAGIC ITEMS

The process of creating an epic magic item is very similar to creating a nonepic magic item. However, certain important differences exist.





### CASTER LEVEL

Spells with an effective level of 10th or higher are possible at epic levels. Because these spell slots aren’t automatically gained at a particular level like 0- to 9th-level spells are, they don’t have a minimum caster level. For this reason, the minimum caster level for any spell of 10th level or higher is set at 11 + spell level.





### PREREQUISITES

In addition to the materials and tools required for nonepic magic items,any epic magic item requires at least two item creation feats: the epic and nonepic version.





### MARKET PRICE

Use the guidelines for nonepic magic itemsto determine the market price of an epic magic item, with one addition: If the item gives a bonus beyond the limit allowed in for normal, nonepic magic items,multiply the portion of the market price derived from that characteristic by 10. Some epic characteristics, such as caster level, don’t trigger this multiplier.





### EXPERIENCE POINT COST

The experience point cost to create an epic magic item is determined differently than for a normal magic item. For all epic magic items other than scrolls, divide the market price by 100, then add 10,000 XP to the result. The final number is the experience point cost to create the item.

For epic scrolls, divide the market price by 25 (as normal for creating a nonepic scroll), then add 1,000 XP to the result. The final number is the experience point cost to create the epic scroll.





### MAGIC ITEM DESCRIPTIONS

In the following sections, each general type of magic item, such as armor or scrolls, has an overall description, followed by descriptions of specific items, if any. Each magic item description and table follows the same format used for nonepic magic items.Specific exceptions are noted as necessary.





##### ARMOR

Except when otherwise stated, epic magic armor and shields follow the rules for nonepic magic armor and shields.

There is no limit to the enhancement bonus of epic magic armor or shields, to the market price modifier of epic magic armor or shield special abilities, or to the total enhancement bonus and market price modifier of epic magic armor or shields.





### EPIC ARMOR AND SHIELD BASE PRICE

To find the base price of an epic suit of magic armor or an epic magic shield, roll on Table: Armor and Shields. Note that the +6 to +10 rows apply only to armor and shields that provide an enhancement bonus of +6 to +10 or armor and shields with a single special ability whose market price modifier is +6 to +10. Magic armor and shields with a total effective bonus of +6 to +10 but that have an enhancement bonus of +5 or less and special abilities whose individual market price modifiers are +5 or less use the table for nonepic magic armorto determine price.

If the ranged attack has an enhancement bonus (or a spell level), the DC increases by that amount. If he or she succeeds, the shield deflects the attack.

### EPIC WEAPON SPECIAL ABILITY DESCRIPTIONS

Most magic weapons only have enhancement bonuses. They can also have special abilities, such as those detailed below and nonepic abilities.A weapon with a special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.





**Acidic Blast:**On command, an acidic blast weapon drips acid (though this deals no damage to the wielder). On any hit, this acid splashes the creature struck, dealing +3d6 points of bonus acid damage. On a successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of acid damage (or +9d6 if the critical multiplier is x3, or +12d6 if the critical multiplier is x4). Bows, crossbows, and slings with this special ability bestow the bonus acid damage upon their ammunition.

Caster Level:21st;Prerequisites:Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor,acid fog; Market Price: +6 bonus.

**Anarchic Power:**This weapon is chaos-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damage reduction. When a weapon of anarchic power strikes a lawful target, this power deals +3d6 points of bonus chaotic damage to the target, and the target gains one negative level (Fortitude DC 23 to remove 24 hours later). On a successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of chaotic damage and bestows two negative levels (or +9d6 and three negative levels if the critical multiplier is x3, or +12d6 and four negative levels if the critical multiplier is x4). The weapon bestows three negative levels on any lawful creature attempting to wield it. These negative levels remain as long as the weapon is in hand and disappear when the weapon is no longer wielded. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (includingrestorationspells) while the weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings with this special ability bestow the anarchic power upon their ammunition. This special ability does not stack with the nonepic anarchic special ability.

Caster Level:21st;Prerequisites:Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor,word of chaos; Market Price: +8 bonus.

**Axiomatic Power:**This weapon is lawful-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damager reduction. When a weapon of axiomatic power strikes a chaotic target, this power erupts forth and deals +3d6 points of bonus lawful damage to the target, and the target gains one negative level (Fortitude DC 23 to remove 24 hours later). On a successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of lawful damage and bestows two negative levels (or +9d6 and three negative levels if the critical multiplier is x3, or +12d6 and four negative levels if the critical multiplier is x4). The weapon bestows three negative levels on any chaotic creature attempting to wield it. These negative levels remain as long as the weapon is in hand and disappear when the weapon is no longer wielded. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (includingrestorationspells) while the weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings with this special ability bestow the lawful power upon their ammunition. This special ability does not stack with the nonepic axiomatic special ability.

Caster Level:23rd;Prerequisites:Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor,dictum; Market Price: +8 bonus.

**Distant Shot:**A distant shot weapon can be used against any target within line of sight at no penalty for range.

Caster Level:21st;Prerequisites:Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor,discern location; Market Price: +6 bonus.

**Dread:**A dread weapon excels at attacking one type of creature. Against its designated foe, its effective enhancement bonus is +4 better than its normal enhancement bonus. Further, it deals +4d6 points of bonus damage against the foe, and if it scores a successful critical hit against the foe, that creature must make a Fortitude save (DC 27) or be destroyed instantly and turned to dust. (This even affects creatures immune to critical hits or death magic.) To randomly determine a dread weapon’s designated foe, roll on the following table.

Caster Level:22nd;Prerequisites:Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor,summon monster IX; Market Price: +7 bonus.

**Everdancing:**An 	everdancing weapon is much like a dancing weapon, though it can be 	loosed with a free action and will fight as long as desired. It can 	move up to 60 feet away from its owner. Its owner can instruct it to 	move to a different target as a move-equivalent action. If its owner 	is rendered unconscious or otherwise unable to direct it, it will 	fight the same opponent as long as that opponent is conscious and 	within range. The owner of an everdancing weapon can grasp it again 	as a free action (assuming it is within reach).

Caster 	Level:23rd;Prerequisites:Craft 	Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor,animate 	objects; Market Price: +8 	bonus.

**Fiery 	Blast:**On 	command, a fiery blast weapon is sheathed in fire (though this deals 	no damage to the wielder). On any hit, this fire engulfs the 	creature struck, dealing +3d6 points of bonus fire damage. On a 	successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of fire damage 	(or +9d6 if the critical multiplier is x3, or +12d6 if the critical 	multiplier is x4).

Caster 	Level:21st;Prerequisites:Craft 	Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor,fireball; 	Market Price: +6 	bonus.

**Holy 	Power:**This 	weapon is good-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damager 	reduction. When a weapon of holy power strikes an evil target, this 	power erupts forth and deals +3d6 points of bonus holy (good) damage 	to the target, and the target gains one negative level (Fortitude DC 	23 to remove 24 hours later). On a successful critical hit it 	instead deals +6d6 points of holy (good) damage and bestows two 	negative levels (or +9d6 and three negative levels if the critical 	multiplier is x3, or +12d6 and four negative levels if the critical 	multiplier is x4). The weapon bestows three negative levels on any 	evil creature attempting to wield it. These negative levels remain 	as long as the weapon is in hand and disappear when the weapon is no 	longer wielded. These negative levels never result in actual level 	loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (includingrestorationspells) 	while the weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings with this 	special ability bestow the holy power upon their ammunition. This 	special ability does not stack with the nonepic holy special 	ability.

Caster 	Level:23rd;Prerequisites:Craft 	Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor,holy 	word; Market Price: +8 	bonus.

**Icy 	Blast:**On 	command, an icy blast weapon is sheathed in icy cold (though this 	deals no damage to the wielder). On any hit, this cold washes over 	the creature struck, dealing	+3d6 points of bonus cold damage. On a 	successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 points of cold damage 	(or +9d6 if the critical multiplier is x3, or +12d6 if the critical 	multiplier is x4). Bows, crossbows, and slings with this special 	ability bestow the bonus cold damage upon their ammunition.

Caster 	Level:21st;Prerequisites:Craft 	Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor,cone 	of cold; Market Price: +6 	bonus.

**Lightning 	Blast:**On 	command, a lightning blast weapon crackles with electrical energy 	(though this deals no damage to the wielder). On any hit, lightning 	coruscates around the creature struck, dealing	 +3d6 points of bonus 	electricity damage. On a successful critical hit it instead deals 	+6d6 points of electricity damage (or +9d6 if the critical 	multiplier is x3, or +12d6 if the critical multiplier is x4). Bows, 	crossbows, and slings with this special ability bestow the bonus 	electricity damage upon their ammunition.

Caster 	Level:21st;Prerequisites:Craft 	Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor,lightning 	bolt; Market Price: +6 	bonus.

**Mighty 	Disruption:**Any 	undead creature struck in combat must succeed at a Fortitude save 	(DC 21) or be destroyed. A weapon of mighty disruption must be a 	bludgeoning weapon. (If this property is rolled for a piercing or 	slashing weapon, reroll.)

Caster 	Level:21st;Prerequisites:Craft 	Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor,true 	resurrection; Market Price: +6 	bonus.

**Sonic 	Blast:**On 	command, a sonic blast weapon emits a low thrumming hum (though this 	deals no damage to the wielder). On any hit, this becomes a 	thunderous roar that deals +3d6 points of bonus sonic damage to the 	creature struck. On a successful critical hit it instead deals +6d6 	points of sonic damage (or +9d6 if the critical multiplier is x3, or 	+12d6 if the critical multiplier is x4). Bows, crossbows, and slings 	with this special ability bestow the bonus sonic damage upon their 	ammunition.

Caster 	Level:21st;Prerequisites:Craft 	Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor,shout; 	Market Price: +6 	bonus.

**Triple-Throw:**This 	special ability can only be placed on a weapon that can be thrown. 	(If this property is rolled for a weapon that cannot be thrown, 	reroll.) A triple-throw weapon creates two duplicates of itself when 	thrown. Both the original and the duplicate weapons attack 	separately (at the same attack bonus). Regardless of the success of 	any of the attacks, the duplicates immediately disappear after the 	attack is completed. Any bonuses on damage due to accuracy or 	precision (including those from sneak attacks, the Precise Shot 	feat, or the ranger’s favored enemy bonus) apply only to the 	original weapon’s damage, not to the duplicates.

Caster 	Level:21st;Prerequisites:Craft 	Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor,shades; 	Market Price: +6 	bonus.

**Unerring 	Accuracy:**Ranged 	attacks made with this weapon negate the AC bonus granted by any 	cover short of total cover. The weapon’s ranged attacks also 	ignore any miss chance from concealment (including total 	concealment, but the must still aim his or her attacks at the 	correct square).

Caster 	Level:21st;Prerequisites:Craft 	Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor,true 	seeing; Market Price: +6 	bonus.

When a weapon of unholy power strikes a good target, this 	power erupts forth and deals +3d6 points of bonus unholy (evil) 	damage to the target, and the target gains one negative level 	(Fortitude DC 23 to remove 24 hours later). On a successful critical 	hit it instead deals +6d6 points of unholy (evil) damage and bestows 	two negative levels (or +9d6 and three negative levels if the 	critical multiplier is x3, or +12d6 and four negative levels if the 	critical multiplier is x4). The weapon bestows three negative levels 	on any good creature attempting to wield it. These negative levels 	remain as long as the weapon is in hand and disappear when the 	weapon is no longer wielded. These negative levels never result in 	actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (includingrestorationspells) 	while the weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings with this 	special ability bestow the unholy power upon their ammunition. This 	special ability does not stack with the nonepic unholy special 	ability.

### EPIC 	ROD DESCRIPTIONS

Standard 	epic rods are described below.





**Besiegement:**This 	rod functions as a +3 	light mace.In 	addition, it is useful for besieging fortifications. Whenever the 	wielder makes a charge attack, the rod improves to a +6 weapon. 	Twice per day, the rod can create a battering ram that lasts for 24 	rounds. This ram can strike once per round, dealing 20 points of 	damage with each hit. It cannot be used to target individuals, only 	fortifications. It can be damaged by normal means (65 hp, AC 22), 	anddisintegrateordispel 	magicdestroys 	it. The rod also has the following powers:Siege 	Engine:One 	heavy catapult, two light catapults, or three siege towers may be 	generated with each use of this power. Each weapon created lasts for 	12 hours. The power can be used three times per day. Ammunition for 	20 shots is included with each weapon created.

Transmute 	Rock to Mud:This 	power can be used three times per day (caster level 24th, save DC 	17).

Caster 	Level:24th;Prerequisites:Craft 	Rod, Craft Epic Rod, Craft Magic Arms and Armor,clenched 	fist, passwall, telepathic bond, transmute rock to mud; Market 	Price:447,745 	gp;Cost 	to Create:224,025 	gp + 14,474 XP.

**Epic 	Absorption:**Like 	arod 	of absorption,this 	rod draws single-target or ray spells and spell-like abilities into 	itself, nullifying the effect and storing the potential spell levels 	until the wielder releases the energy in the form of spells of his 	or her own. Spells of any level (including those boosted beyond 9th 	level by metamagic) can be absorbed, although epic spells cannot. 	The rod absorbs a maximum of 150 spell levels and can thereafter 	only discharge any remaining potential it might have. The rod cannot 	be recharged.

Caster 	Level:23rd;Prerequisites:Craft 	Rod, Craft Epic Rod, Empower Spell, Maximize Spell, empowered 	maximizedspell 	turning; Market Price:1,500,000 	gp.

**Epic 	Cancellation:**This 	rod’s touch drains an item of all magical properties, including 	the magical energy in epic magic items (but not most artifacts). The 	item touched gets a Will saving throw (DC 26). If a creature is 	holding the magic item at the time, then the item can use the 	holder’s Will save bonus in place of its own. In such cases, 	contact is established by making a melee touch attack roll. Upon 	draining three items, the rod becomes brittle and useless. Drained 	items can only be restored bywish, 	miracle,or 	epic spells specifically designed to restore lost power. Arod 	of epic cancellationcan 	neutralize a normalsphere 	of annihilationwithout 	itself being cancelled.

Caster 	Level:25th;Prerequisites:Craft 	Rod, Craft Epic Rod,dispel 	magic; Market Price:330,000 	gp.

**Epic 	Might:**This 	rod is similar to arod 	of lordly might,although 	it is far more powerful. It is larger than its normal counterpart, 	and it is constructed of adamantine rather than normal metal. It has 	six buttons, several spell-like functions, and several mundane uses, 	and it can also be used as a magic weapon of various sorts.

The 	following spell-like functions of the rod can each be used once per 	day.

•Dominate 	Person:Touched 	foe is recipient of adominate 	personspell, 	if the wielder so commands (Will save DC 24). The wielder must 	choose to use this power and then succeed with a melee touch attack 	to activate the power. If the attack fails, the effect is lost.

•Stun:Upon 	command, all enemies viewing the rod are stunned, as per thepower 	word, stunspell 	(10-foot maximum range, Will save DC 24). Invoking this power is a 	standard action.

•Damage:Upon 	command, the rod deals 10d8 points of damage to an opponent on a 	successful touch attack and cures the wielder of a like amount of 	damage (Will save DC 26). The wielder must choose to use this power 	before attacking, as withdominate 	person.

The 	following weapon uses of the rod have no limits on their use.

•In 	its normal form, the rod can be used as a	 +6 	heavy mace.

•When 	button 1 is pushed, the rod becomes a +3 	longsword of fiery blasting.

•When 	button 2 is pushed, the rod becomes a +8 	battleaxe.

•When 	button 3 is pushed, the rod becomes a +10 	shortspearor 	+10 	longspear.

The 	following mundane uses of the rod also have no limits on their use.

•Climbing 	pole/ladder: When button 4 is pushed, a spike that can anchor in 	granite is extruded from the ball, while the other end sprouts three 	sharp hooks. The rod lengthens to anywhere between 5 and 150 feet in 	a single round, stopping when button 4 is pushed again. Horizontal 	bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, in 	staggered progression. The rod is firmly held by the spike and hooks 	and can bear up to 10,000 pounds. The wielder can retract the pole 	by pushing button 5.

•The 	ladder function can be used to force open doors. The wielder plants 	the rod’s base 30 feet or less from the portal to be forced and in 	line with it, then pushes button 4. The force exerted has a Strength 	bonus of	+24.

•When 	button 6 is pushed, the rod indicates magnetic north and gives the 	wielder a knowledge of his or her approximate depth beneath the 	surface or height above it.

Caster 	Level:30th;Prerequisites:Craft 	Rod, Craft Epic Rod, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Epic Magic 	Arms and Armor,cure 	critical wounds, inflict critical wounds, bull’s strength, 	fireball, dominate person, power word stun; Market Price:4,293,432 	gp;Cost 	to Create:2,151,372 	gp + 52,841 XP.

**Epic 	Negation:**This 	rod negates the spell or spell-like function or functions of magic 	items, including epic magic items (but not artifacts). The wielder 	points the rod at the magic item, and a beam shoots forth to touch 	the target device, attacking as a ray (a ranged touch attack). The 	ray negates any currently active item function and has a 75% chance 	to negate any other spell or spell-like functions of that device, 	regardless of the level or power of the functions, for 2d4 rounds. 	To negate instantaneous effects, the rod wielder needs to have 	readied an action. The target item gets no saving throw or means to 	resist this effect. The rod can function three times per day.

Caster 	Level:24th;Prerequisites:Craft 	Rod, Craft Epic Rod,dispel 	magic, limited wishormiracle; 	Market Price:446,000 	gp.

**Epic 	Rulership:**This 	rod appears to be a royal scepter worth at least 25,000 gp in 	materials and work-manship alone. The wielder can command the 	obedience and fealty of creatures within 360 feet when he or she 	activates the device (a standard action). Creatures totaling 900 Hit 	Dice can be ruled, but creatures with Intelligence scores of 17 or 	higher are entitled to a Will saving throw (DC 29) to negate the 	effect. Ruled creatures obey the wielder as if he or she were their 	absolute sovereign. Still, if the wielder gives a command that is 	contrary to the nature of the creatures commanded, the magic is 	broken. The rod can be used for 1,500 total minutes before crumbling 	to dust. This duration need not be continuous.

Caster 	Level:25th;Prerequisites:Craft 	Rod, Craft Epic Rod, Improved Heighten Spell, improved heightenedmass 	charm; Market Price:575,000 	gp;Cost 	to Create:300,000 	gp + 15,500 XP.

**Epic 	Spellcaster:**This 	magnificent adamantine rod grants its wielder a +10 insight bonus on 	Spellcraft checks made to cast epic spells for as long as he or she 	holds or carries the rod.

Caster 	Level:21st;Prerequisites:Craft 	Rod, Craft Epic Rod;Market 	Price:245,400 	gp.

**Epic 	Splendor:**This 	rod grants its wielder a +8 enhancement bonus to Charisma for as 	long as he or she holds or carries the item. Three times per day, 	the rod creates and garbs him or her in clothing of the finest 	fabrics, plus adornments of fur and jewels. Apparel created by the 	rod can remain in existence up to 24 hours. The value of the garb 	ranges from 70,000 to 100,000 gp (1d4+6 x10,000 gp)—10,000 gp for 	the fabric, 50,000 gp for the furs, and the rest for jewel trim 	(maximum of 40 gems, maximum value 1,000 gp each). In addition, the 	rod can, once per week, create a palatial mansion in any floor plan 	the user desires. The mansion is palatial, able to accommodate up to 	250 people, housing them in private chambers and serving them fine 	banquets. The mansion lasts for three days, after which time it, and 	everything originally in it (including items removed from the 	mansion), disappear.

Caster 	Level:21st;Prerequisites:Craft 	Rod, Craft Epic Rod,fabricate, 	mage’s magnificent mansion; Market Price:297,400 	gp;Cost 	to Create:191,200 	gp + 12,124 XP.

**Excellent 	Magic:**Once 	per day when casting a nonepic or epic spell that has an experience 	point component, the rod supplies up to 2,000 XP, not the caster. If 	more experience points are required to cast the spell, the caster 	provides them. As a special use of the rod, the caster can 	substitute the power inherent in the rod for the experience point 	development cost of an epic spell. Doing so drains all the power 	from the rod, rendering it useless.

Caster 	Level:21st;Prerequisites:Craft 	Rod, Craft Epic Rod;Market 	Price:650,000 	gp;Cost 	to Create:325,000 	gp + 26,000 XP.

**Fortification:**This 	rod functions as a +3 	light mace.In 	addition, it is useful for the construction and defense of 	fortifications. Whenever the wielder is benefiting from cover, the 	rod improves that to nine-tenths cover (+10 cover AC bonus and +4 	cover Reflex save bonus; failure on the save results in half damage 	and success results in no damage). Three times per day, the rod can 	create food and water, as per the cleric spell, for twenty-four 	people. The rod also has the following powers:Fortify:Four 	times per day, a stone wall can be created that is 12 inches thick, 	10 feet high, and 30 feet long. This wall has a parapet and 	battlements across the top. (Alternatively, the power can be used to 	mend a broken existing wall. The gap to be filled can be no more 	than 300 square feet in area.) In addition, once per day, a great 	door of iron can be created that is set into one of the newly 	created walls. This door, 4 inches thick, may be a double door, a 	drawbridge, or a portcullis, as chosen by the wielder.Siege 	Engine:One 	heavy catapult, two light catapults, or three ballistae may be 	generated with each use of this power. The power can be used four 	times per day. Ammunition for 20 shots is included with each weapon 	created.

Caster 	Level:20th;Prerequisites:Craft 	Rod, Craft Epic Rod,iron 	body, resistance, spell resistance; Market Price:600,000 	gp.

**Nightmares:**Anyone 	who comes within 20 feet of the wielder of this rod feels a grave 	sense of unease. Each person so affected must make a Will save (DC 	17) or suffer the effects of anightmarespell 	the next time he or she falls asleep. The wielder is immune to this 	effect. Three times per day, the wielder can utter a command word 	that causes the rod to emit a horrid, inhuman scream. Up to twenty 	of the closest creatures within a 30-foot radius who hear this 	terrible wail believe that their worst nightmares have become 	reality and suffer the effects of awail 	of the bansheespell 	(DC 23).

Caster 	Level:21st;Prerequisites:Craft 	Rod, Craft Epic Rod,nightmare, 	permanency, wail of the banshee; Market Price:284,000 	gp.

**Paradise:**This 	item creates a nondimensional space, similar in effect to arod 	of security. 	However, the rod’s possessor and up to 999 other creatures can 	stay in complete safety for up to 1,000 days divided by the number 	of creatures affected. Natural healing takes place at five times the 	normal pace. The rod functions like its nonepic counterpart in all 	other ways.

**The 	Path:**This 	rod serves as an aid to trailblazing and travel. It grants the 	wielder a +30 enhancement bonus on Wilderness Lore checks for 	tracking and Intuit Direction checks. The handle of the rod is 	hollow, functioning like a telescope. When the wielder peers through 	it, the limits of vision are three times normal (and spotting 	distances for encounters are tripled). In addition, the telescoping 	handle enables the wielder to view things as though affected by atrue 	seeingspell. 	The rod also has the following powers.Map:Three 	times per day a section of the rod unrolls like a scroll from a 	tube, revealing a map of the surrounding area, centered on the 	location of the rod. The area shown on the map covers an area as 	small as 50 feet in radius to as large as 24 miles in radius, 	zooming in or out with a set of command words. The map reveals 	natural topography and all types of structures (even hidden ones), 	but it will not show the location of creatures.

Passage:Three 	times per day, this power allows the wielder and up to five others 	in a 20-foot radius to move unhindered through natural plant growth 	or bodies of water (as per thefreedom 	of movementspell).

Bridge:Once 	per day, this power allows the user to create a 5-foot-wide, 	40-foot-long stone cause-way across chasms and canyons. The bridge 	created lasts for 1 hour.

Pass 	without Trace:Once 	per day, this power can be used on the wielder and twenty others, 	for 21 minutes. It is otherwise as the spell of the same name 	(caster level 24th).

**Restless 	Death:**The 	holder of this rod can rebuke or control undead as if he or she were 	four levels higher. (The rod doesn’t grant the ability to rebuke 	or control undead if the holder doesn’t already have it.) In 	addition, the wielder may speak a command word to castanimate 	dead. 	Any skeletons or zombies animated by the rod’s power are 	automatically controlled by the rod, up to the rod’s maximum limit 	of 42 HD, and they follow the orders of the rod’s wielder. These 	undead don’t count toward the wielder’s limit of controlled 	undead. Finally, the wielder can speak a second command word to castslay 	living(heightened 	to 10th level; DC 25).

**Wyrm:**Any 	of the various rods in this series functions as a +5 	quarterstaff.Upon 	casting the rod to the ground (a standard action) and uttering a 	command word, the rod grows into a specific type of dragon 	(depending on the specific type of rod) by the end of the round. The 	dragon created is a wyrm and obeys the commands of the owner. The 	dragon returns to rod form (a full-round action) whenever the 	wielder desires, or whenever it moves farther than 500 feet from the 	owner. If the dragon form is slain, it returns to rod form and 	cannot be activated again for three days. Awyrm 	rodonly 	functions if the possessor is of the same alignment as the dragon 	type.
