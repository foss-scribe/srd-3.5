Class Features {#class-features .western}
==============

All of the following are class features of the adept NPC class.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** Adepts are skilled with all simple
weapons. Adepts are not proficient with any type of armor nor with
shields.

**Spells:** An adept casts divine spells which are drawn from the adept
spell list (see below). Like a cleric, an adept must choose and prepare
her spells in advance. Unlike a cleric, an adept cannot spontaneously
cast *cure* or *inflict* spells.

To prepare or cast a spell, an adept must have a Wisdom score equal to
at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw
against an adept's spell is 10 + the spell level + the adept's Wisdom
modifier.

Adepts, unlike wizards, do not acquire their spells from books or
scrolls, nor do they prepare them through study. Instead, they meditate
or pray for their spells, receiving them as divine inspiration or
through their own strength of faith. Each adept must choose a time each
day at which she must spend an hour in quiet contemplation or
supplication to regain her daily allotment of spells. Time spent resting
has no effect on whether an adept can prepare spells.

Like other spellcasters, an adept can cast only a certain number of
spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is
given on Table: The Adept. In addition, she receives bonus spells per
day if she has a high Wisdom score.

When Table: The Adept indicates that the adept gets 0 spells per day of
a given spell level, she gains only the bonus spells she would be
entitled to based on her Wisdom score for that spell level.

Each adept has a particular holy symbol (as a divine focus) depending on
the adept's magical tradition.

**Summon Familiar:** At 2nd level, an adept can call a familiar, just as
a sorcerer or wizard can.

\

**Adept Spell List**

Adepts choose their spells from the following list.

0 Level: *create water, cure minor wounds, detect magic, ghost sound,
guidance, light, mending, purify food and drink, read magic, touch of
fatigue.*

1st Level: *bless, burning hands, cause fear, command, comprehend
languages, cure light wounds, detect chaos, detect evil, detect good,
detect law, endure elements, obscuring mist, protection from chaos,

2nd Level: *aid, animal trance, bear's endurance, bull's strength, cat's
grace, cure moderate wounds, darkness, delay poison, invisibility,
mirror image, resist energy, scorching ray, see invisibility, web.*

3rd Level: *animate dead, bestow curse, contagion, continual flame, cure
serious wounds, daylight, deeper darkness, lightning bolt, neutralize
poison, remove curse, remove disease, tongues.*

4th Level: *cure critical wounds, minor creation, polymorph,
restoration, stoneskin, wall of fire.*

5th Level: *baleful polymorph, break enchantment, commune, heal, major
creation, raise dead, true seeing, wall of stone.*
