MONSTERS (ANIMALS)





This section provides statistics and basic information for many common kinds of mundane animals. These creatures generally operate on instinct, driven by simple needs such as food and reproduction. Most animals, even predators, do not attack unless they or their young are threatened.

Animals are not capable of detailed reasoning, although with the Handle Animal skill it is possible to tame an animal and teach it to perform certain tricks.

Some herbivorous animals do not normally use their natural weapons to attack. As such, their natural weapons are treated as secondary attacks. The animal’s attack and damage entries note this fact, with an explanatory footnote.





**Animal Traits:** An animal possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).

—Intelligence score of 1 or 2 (no creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher can be an animal).

—Low-light vision.

—Alignment:Always neutral. Animals are not governed by a human sense of morality.

—Treasure:None. Animals never possess treasure.

**Constrict (Ex):** On a successful grapple check, a constrictor snake deals 1d3+4 points of damage.

**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, a constrictor snake must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.

SQUID



















































































![47 MonstersAnimals-Table48.png](47 MonstersAnimals-Table48.png)

These free-swimming mollusks are fairly aggressive. They are more feared than sharks in some locales.

Combat

**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, a squid must hit an opponent of any size with its arms attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and automatically deals bite damage. *A squid has a +4 racial bonus on grapple checks.

**Ink Cloud (Ex):** A squid can emit a cloud of jet-black ink 10 feet high by 10 feet wide by 10 feet long once per minute as a free action. The cloud provides total concealment, which the squid normally uses to escape a losing fight. All vision within the cloud is obscured.

**Jet (Ex):** A squid can jet backward once per round as a full-round action, at a speed of 240 feet. It must move in a straight line, but does not provoke attacks of opportunity while jetting.

SQUID, GIANT



















































































![47 MonstersAnimals-Table49.png](47 MonstersAnimals-Table49.png)

These voracious creatures can have bodies more than 20 feet long and attack almost anything they meet.

Combat

An opponent can attack a giant squid’s tentacles with a sunder attempt as if they were weapons. A giant squid’s tentacles have 10 hit points each. If a giant squid is currently grappling a target with the tentacle that is being attacked, it usually uses another limb to make its attack of opportunity against the opponent making the sunder attempt. Severing one of a giant squid’s tentacles deals 5 points of damage to the creature. A giant squid usually withdraws from combat if it loses five tentacles. The creature regrows severed limbs in 1d10+10 days.

**Constrict (Ex):** A giant squid deals 1d6+8 points of damage with a successful grapple check.

**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, a giant squid must hit an opponent of any size with a tentacle attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict. *A giant squid has a +4 racial bonus on grapple checks.

**Ink Cloud (Ex):** A giant squid can emit a cloud of jet-black ink 20 feet high by 20 feet wide by 20 feet long once per minute as a free action. The cloud provides total concealment, which the squid normally uses to escape a losing fight. All vision within the cloud is obscured.

**Jet (Ex):** A giant squid can jet backward once per round as a full-round action, at a speed of 320 feet. It must move in a straight line, but does not provoke attacks of opportunity while jetting.

**Skills:** A giant squid has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.





TIGER



















































































![47 MonstersAnimals-Table50.png](47 MonstersAnimals-Table50.png)

These great cats stand more than 3 feet tall at the shoulder and are about 9 feet long. They weigh from 400 to 600 pounds.

Combat

**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, a tiger must hit with a claw or bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can rake.

**Pounce (Ex):** If a tiger charges a foe, it can make a full attack, including two rake attacks.

**Rake (Ex):** Attack bonus +9 melee, damage 1d8+3.

These diminutive amphibians are innocuous and beneficial, since they eat insects.

**Skills:** A toad’s coloration gives it a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks.





WEASEL



















































































![47 MonstersAnimals-Table52.png](47 MonstersAnimals-Table52.png)

These little mammals are aggressive predators but usually confine themselves to smaller prey. The statistics presented here can also apply to ferrets.

Combat

**Attach (Ex):** If a weasel hits with a bite attack, it uses its powerful jaws to latch onto the opponent’s body and automatically deals bite damage each round it remains attached. An attached weasel loses its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class and has an AC of 12. An attached weasel can be struck with a weapon or grappled itself. To remove an attached weasel through grappling, the opponent must achieve a pin against the creature.

**Skills:** Weasels have a +4 racial bonus on Move Silently checks and a +8 racial bonus on Balance and Climb checks. They use their Dexterity modifier for Climb checks. A weasel can always choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or threatened.





WHALE

Some varieties of these seagoing mammals are among the largest animals known. Relatively small whales (such as the orca presented here) can be vicious predators, attacking virtually anything they detect.

**Blindsight (Ex):** Whales can “see” by emitting high-frequency sounds, inaudible to most other creatures, that allow them to locate objects and creatures within 120 feet. Asilencespell negates this and forces the whale to rely on its vision, which is approximately as good as a human’s.

**Hold Breath (Ex):** A whale can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to 8 x its Constitution score before it risks drowning.

**Skills:** A whale has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line. *A whale has a +4 racial bonus on Spot and Listen checks. These bonuses are lost if its blindsight is negated.



























































































![47 MonstersAnimals-Table53.png](47 MonstersAnimals-Table53.png)

The statistics here describe a plankton-feeding whale between 30 and 60 feet long, such as gray, humpback, and right whales. These massive creatures are surprisingly gentle. If harassed or provoked, they are as likely to flee as they are to retaliate.



























































































![47 MonstersAnimals-Table54.png](47 MonstersAnimals-Table54.png)

Also known as sperm whales, these creatures can be up to 60 feet long. They prey on giant squids.



























































































![47 MonstersAnimals-Table55.png](47 MonstersAnimals-Table55.png)

These ferocious creatures are about 30 feet long. They eat fish, squid, seals, and other whales.





WOLF



















































































![47 MonstersAnimals-Table56.png](47 MonstersAnimals-Table56.png)

Wolves are pack hunters known for their persistence and cunning.

Combat

A favorite tactic is to send a few individuals against the foe’s front while the rest of the pack circles and attacks from the flanks or rear.

**Trip (Ex):** A wolf that hits with a bite attack can attempt to trip the opponent (+1 check modifier) as a free action without making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the wolf.

**Skills:** *Wolves have a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks when tracking by scent.





WOLVERINE



















































































![47 MonstersAnimals-Table57.png](47 MonstersAnimals-Table57.png)

These creatures are similar to badgers but are bigger, stronger, and even more ferocious.

COMBAT
