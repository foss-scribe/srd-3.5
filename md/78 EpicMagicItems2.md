### SCROLLS

To generate an epic scroll randomly, first roll on Table: Scroll Types to determine whether the spells are arcane or divine. An epic scroll contains 1d8 spells. For each spell, roll on Table: Epic Scroll Spell Levels to determine its level and then on the appropriate section of Table: Actual Spell Levels to determine the spell’s actual level and total metamagic level adjustments. To determine the specific metamagic level adjustments, roll on the appropriate section of Table: Metamagic Level Adjustment to Spells. To determine the spell, use the appropriate sections of the nonepic scroll tables.

### STAFFS

Staffs have 50 charges when created, and they can’t be recharged.

Staffs use the wielder’s ability score and relevant feats to set the DC for saves against their spells in such cases where those values would be higher than the listed values for the staffs.

Successful Reflex saving throws (DC 17) reduce the damage sustained by half. The character breaking the staff has a 50% chance of traveling to another plane of existence; if he or she does not, the explosive release of spell energy destroys him or her.

When two bounded spaces are attuned, an interdimensional portal springs up at each location, and the two portals are connected. When the wielder creates a pair of portals, he or she also establishes the necessary key that travelers must have to access the portal. Possible keys include nothing, a pearl, a particular hair color, or even thegate keyitself. Up to sixty different pairs of portals can be attuned in this manner.

### INTELLIGENT ITEMS

Just like nonepic magic items, epic magic items sometimes possess intelligence of their own. Such items are fully sentient and should be treated as NPCs. The Random Epic Magic Items section details the chances that epic armor, shields, rings, rods, staffs, wondrous items, and weapons might be intelligent. In short, a ring, rod, staff, wondrous item, armor, or shield has a 1% chance to be intelligent, a ranged weapon has a 5% chance to be intelligent, and a melee weapon has a 15% chance to be intelligent. Rather than using the tables for nonepic items,use the tables below to determine the properties of an intelligent item: the number of powers, unusual properties, alignment, and special purpose of the item (if any). Of the three mental ability scores, two scores are favored (2d6 + some number) and one is completely random (3d6). Choose which scores get assigned which number, or roll 1d4 and determine randomly according to the following table.





**Table: Mental Ability Scores for Intelligent Items**











































![78 EpicMagicItems2-Table25.png](78 EpicMagicItems2-Table25.png)





The first step in determining the properties of a random intelligent epic magic item is to determine its general capabilities. These are found by rolling d% and consulting Table: Epic Items Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and Capabilities.





**Table: Epic Item Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and Capabilities**























































![78 EpicMagicItems2-Table26.png](78 EpicMagicItems2-Table26.png)





### MARKET PRICE MODIFIER

To find the market price for an epic magic item, use these expanded guidelines, adjusting as necessary to find an appropriate final price. Each point of Intelligence bonus, Wisdom bonus, or Charisma bonus increases the item’s market price by 400 gp. Any form of communication possessed by the item increases its market price by the number shown on Table: Epic Item Communication. Each primary ability possessed by the item increases its market price by 2,000 to 10,000 gp (average 6,000 gp). Each extraordinary ability possessed by the item increases its market price by 15,000 to 35,000 gp (average 25,000 gp). A special purpose increases the item’s market price by 50,000 gp. An awesome power increases the item’s market price by 100,000 gp.





### INTELLIGENT ITEM ALIGNMENT

Any item with Intelligence has an alignment. Make sure that the alignment choosen or determine randomly (using Table: Item Alignment) matches any alignment-oriented special abilities of the item. Any character whose alignment is not compatible with that of the item gains one negative level for every 10 points of the weapon’s Ego (see Item Ego, below) if he or she so much as picks up the item. Although this never results in actual level loss, the negative levels remain as long as the item is in hand and cannot be overcome in any way (includingrestorationspells). These negative levels are cumulative with any other penalties the item might already place on inappropriate wielders.





**Table: Item Alignment**













































![78 EpicMagicItems2-Table27.png](78 EpicMagicItems2-Table27.png)





### ITEM COMMUNICATION

Like a character, an intelligent item speaks Common plus one language per point of Intelligence bonus. Choose appropriate languages, taking into account the item’s origin and purposes. An item with multiple modes of communication can use any of its modes at will.





**Table: Epic Item Communication**







## 







































![78 EpicMagicItems2-Table28.png](78 EpicMagicItems2-Table28.png)





### INTELLIGENT ITEM ABILITIES

Using the number of capabilities determined above, find the item’s specific abilities by rolling on the appropriate tables below.





**Table: Intelligent Item Primary Abilities**







































































































![78 EpicMagicItems2-Table29.png](78 EpicMagicItems2-Table29.png)





If the same ability is rolled twice or more, the range, frequency, or effectiveness of the power is doubled, tripled, and so on. All abilities function only when the item is held, drawn, or otherwise brandished and the possessor is concentrating on the desired result. Activating a power is a standard action, but using a free feat is not. Feats may be used regardless of prerequisites, but the item still must be held and drawn (or worn, in the case of such items). An intelligent item might activate a power on its own.





**Table: Intelligent Item Extraordinary Powers**







## 





































































































































































![78 EpicMagicItems2-Table30.png](78 EpicMagicItems2-Table30.png)





If the same power is rolled twice, the uses per day are doubled. (Iftrue seeingorpasswallis rolled twice, roll again.) Powers function only when the item is drawn and held, and the possessor is concentrating upon the desired effect. Activating a power is a standard action. An intelligent item might activate a power on its own.





**Table: Intelligent Item Awesome Powers**







## 



























































































































![78 EpicMagicItems2-Table31.png](78 EpicMagicItems2-Table31.png)





Unless otherwise stated, all awesome powers function at 20th caster level. If a power is rolled twice, the uses per day are doubled. Powers function only when the item is drawn and held, and the possessor is concentrating upon the desired effect. Activating a power is a standard action. An intelligent item might activate a power on its own.





### SPECIAL PURPOSE ITEMS

###### Purpose

An item’s purpose must suit the type and alignment of the item and should always be treated reasonably.





**Table: Intelligent Item Purpose**





















































![78 EpicMagicItems2-Table32.png](78 EpicMagicItems2-Table32.png)





### SPECIAL PURPOSE POWER

A special purpose power operates only when the item is in pursuit of its special purpose. This is always up to the purview of the item. It should always be easy and straightforward to see how the ends justify the means. That is to say that if the player’s reasoning for how a particular action serves the item’s purpose is not completely believable, the item won’t allow it.





**Table: Intelligent Item Special Purpose Powers**











































![78 EpicMagicItems2-Table33.png](78 EpicMagicItems2-Table33.png)





### ITEM EGO

Ego is a measure of the total power and force of personality that an item possesses. Only after all aspects of an item have been generated and recorded can its Ego score be determined. Ego is a factor with regard to the dominance of item over character, as detailed below.

**Table: Item Ego**





#### 























































![78 EpicMagicItems2-Table34.png](78 EpicMagicItems2-Table34.png)





### ITEMS AGAINST CHARACTERS

When an item has an Ego of its own, it has a will of its own. The item is, of course, absolutely true to its alignment. If the character who possesses the item is not true to that alignment’s goals or the item’s special purpose, personality conflict—item against character—results. Similarly, any item with an Ego score of 20 or higher always considers itself superior to any character, and a personality conflict results if the possessor does not always agree with the item. When a personality conflict occurs, the possessor must make a Will saving throw (DC = item’s Ego). If the possessor succeeds, he or she is dominant. If he or she fails, the item is dominant. Dominance lasts for one day or until a critical situation occurs (such as a major battle, a serious threat to either item or character, and so on). Should an item gain dominance, it resists the character’s desires and demands concessions such as any of the following:

•Removal of associates or items whose alignment or personality is distasteful to the item.

•The character divesting him or herself of all other magic items or items of a certain type.

•Obedience from the character so the item can direct where they go for its own purposes.

•Immediate seeking out and slaying of creatures hateful to the item.

•Magical protections and devices to protect the item from molestation when it is not in use.

•That the character carry the item with him or her on all occasions.

•That the character relinquish the item in favor of a more suitable possessor due to alignment differences or conduct.





In extreme circumstances, the item can resort to even harsher measures.

•Force its possessor into combat.

•Refuse to strike opponents.

•Strike at its wielder or his or her associates.

•Force its possessor to surrender to an opponent.

•Cause itself to drop from the character’s grasp.





Naturally, such actions are unlikely when harmony reigns between the character’s and item’s alignments or when their purposes and personalities are well matched. Even so, an item might wish to have a lesser character possess it in order to easily command him or her, or a higher-level possessor so as to better accomplish its goals. All magic items with personalities desire to play an important role in whatever activity is under way, particularly combat. Such items are rivals of each other, even if they are of the same alignment. No intelligent item wants to share its wielder with others. An intelligent item is aware of the presence of any other intelligent item within 60 feet, and most intelligent items try their best to mislead or distract their host so that he or she ignores or destroys the rival. Of course, alignment might change this sort of behavior.

Items with personalities are never totally controlled or silenced by the characters who possess them, even though they may never successfully control their possessor. They may be powerless to force their demands but remain undaunted and continue to air their wishes and demands.





### ARTIFACTS





### MINOR ARTIFACTS

Minor artifacts are not necessarily unique items, but rather magic items that no longer can be made by common mortal means—even by the hands of epic creators. Such items have no established market price. Below is a selection of known minor artifacts.





**Everfull Purse:**This leather belt pouch has the power to turn a single gold coin into many overnight. If a single gold piece is placed in theeverfull purseat sunset, it will be replaced at sunrise by 25 gold pieces. Thepursehas no effect if more than one gold piece is left within, or if anything other than gold is placed within.

Caster Level:20th;Weight:1/2 lb.

**Libram of Gainful Conjuration:**This mystic book is of great value to arcane spellcasters of good alignment (LG, NG, CG). Study of the work requires one week.

**Rogue’s Dice:**This pair of cubes appears much like any other pair of typical (6-sided) dice. A character with a pair ofrogue’s dicewho wishes to roll them must announce that he or she is rolling the dice (accidental rolls have no effect). Rolling the dice is a standard action, and both dice must be rolled simultaneously to have any effect. The player should roll 2d6 and consult the table below to determine thedice’saffects.



















































![78 EpicMagicItems2-Table35.png](78 EpicMagicItems2-Table35.png)

No character can gain any effect from an additional roll of the dice within 24 hours, with two exceptions. If a 2 is rolled, the dice automatically roll themselves at the beginning of the character’s next turn and he or she must accept the additional result. If a 12 is rolled, the character may choose to roll again in the next round (if more than 1 full round elapses between the roll of 12 and this bonus roll, the character loses the bonus roll). There is no method (mundane or magical) to predict or influence the result of a roll ofRogue’s dice. Even powerful divination magic can’t predict the outcome of a roll before it is made.

### MAJOR ARTIFACTS





**Axe of the Dwarvish Lords:**This is a +6 keen throwing goblinoid bane dwarven waraxe. Any dwarf who holds it doubles the range of his or her darkvision. Any nondwarf who grasps theAxetakes 2 points of temporary Charisma damage; these points cannot be healed or restored in any way while theAxeis held. The current owner of theAxegains a +10 bonus on Craft (armorsmithing, blacksmithing, gemcutting, stonemasonry, and weaponsmithing) checks. The wielder of theAxecan summon an elder earth elemental (assummon monster IX;duration 20 rounds) once per week.

**Codex of the Infinite Planes:**TheCodexis enormous—supposedly, it requires two strong men to lift it. No matter how many pages are turned, another always remains. Anyone opening theCodexfor the first time is utterly annihilated, as with adestructionspell (Fortitude DC 30 for only 10d6 damage). Those who survive can peruse its pages and learn its powers, though not without risk. Each day spent studying theCodexallows the reader to make a Spellcraft check (DC 50) to learn one of its powers (choose the power learned randomly; add a +1 circumstance bonus on the check per additional day spent reading until a power is learned). However, each day of study also forces the reader to make a Will save (DC 30 + 1 per day of study) to avoid being driven insane (as theinsanityspell). The powers of theCodex of the Infinite Planesare as follows:astral projection, banishment, elemental swarm, gate, greater planar ally, greater planar binding, plane shift,andsoul bind.Each is usable at will by the owner of theCodex(assuming that he or she has learned how to access the power). TheCodex of the Infinite Planeshas a caster level of 30th for the purposes of all powers and catastrophes, and all saving throw DCs are 20 + spell level. Activating any power requires both a Concentration check and a Spellcraft check (DC 40 + twice the spell level of the power; the character can’t take 10 on this check). Any failure on either check indicates a catastrophe befalls the user (roll on the table below for the effect). A character can only incur one catastrophe per power use, even if he or she fails both checks.























![78 EpicMagicItems2-Table36.png](78 EpicMagicItems2-Table36.png)

**Cup and Talisman of the Demigod:**TheCupis a large gem-set golden chalice requiring two hands to lift. It emits light (as thedaylightspell) at all times and automatically dispels any darkness-based spells whose area it enters. If the cup is filled with holy water (requiring a full gallon), that substance will act as apotion of cure critical woundsor apotion of neutralize poison(owner’s choice) if drunk. This liquid can’t be saved or stored in any way. TheTalismanis a small eight-pointed platinum star hanging from a chain of gold and pearls. The wearer gains a +6 enhancement bonus to Charisma and may castremove blindness/deafness, remove curse,andremove diseaseat will. Furthermore, if theTalismanis placed within theCupand theCupfilled with holy water, that liquid acts as a special elixir ofresurrection(as the spell). This effect will function only once per month. Any evil or chaotic creature that touches theCuporTalismanis struck with aholy word(if evil) ordictum(if chaotic) spell (or both if the creature is chaotic evil).

**Eye of the Orc:**This lump of rock has a marquis-cut black sapphire set in its center, making it appear similar to a large eye. If possessed by an orc, it grants a +6 enhancement bonus to Strength and Charisma, and the orc’s darkvision range is doubled. Nonorcs who possess theEyegain a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength but take a –2 penalty to Intelligence and Charisma. Regardless of the owner’s race, any weapon wielded by the owner of theEyeis considered anelf bane weapon. Furthermore, by holding theEyebefore the character, he or she can perceive things as if he or she hadtrue seeingcast upon him or her. This can be activated only once per day but lasts as long as the character concentrates on it (requiring a standard action each round).

**Golem Armor:**This enormous suit of black iron +10 full plate armorincreases the wearer’s size by one category (to a maximum of Colossal). The wearer gains a +10 enhancement bonus to Strength and is rendered immune to mind-affecting effects, poison, disease, and similar effects. He or she is not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, energy drain, or death from massive damage.Golem Armoris immune to rust attacks. The wearer ofGolem Armorgains damage reduction 15/adamantine. He or she also cannot regain hit points by any means (mundane or magical) while the armor is worn. It requires 1 hour to don or extract oneself fromGolem Armor.

**Invulnerable Coat:**TheInvulnerable Coat+5 chain shirt of heavy fortification. It grants its wearer damage reduction 10/epic and resistance 20 against acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic energy. If the wearer can turn undead, treat the wearer as having +4 class levels for purposes of caster level, turning undead, smiting evil, and laying on hands.

**Iron Gauntlet of War:**TheGauntletgrants a +8 enhancement bonus to Strength. The wearer doubles the damage bonus on any smite attacks he or she makes. If the wearer has the Leadership feat, the wearer’s Leadership score increases by +4, but the wearer can never attract or keep followers or cohorts who are good or chaotic. Once per day, the wielder can useimplosionas a 20th-level caster (DC 23). TheIron Gauntlet of Waris intelligent (Int 13, Wis 18, Cha 24, Ego 26) and lawful evil. It can communicate telepathically with its wearer, though it cannot speak. It will always seek to dominate any wearer who isn’t lawful evil, forcing such an owner to commit lawful evil deeds (or else find a more suitable wearer).

**Ring of Nine Facets:**This ring is set with a gem of nine facets, each one in-scribed with a different incomprehensible rune. Each day at sunrise, the gem turns to display a different facet. The active facet determines theRing’s power for that day. Each day, roll 1d10 to determine which facet (and thus which power) is active.



















































![78 EpicMagicItems2-Table37.png](78 EpicMagicItems2-Table37.png)





The wearer of theRingcan, with a great deal of mental exertion, attempt to change the active facet away from one he or she does not desire. This requires a full-round action and a Concentration check (DC 50), and deals 2d6 points of nonlethal damage regardless of success. If the save is successful, the new facet is determined randomly. If theRingis removed, the former wearer takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage each minute until it is replaced or until his or her nonlethal damage exceeds his or her current hit points (though the nonlethal damage resumes again immediately when the former wearer regains consciousness).
