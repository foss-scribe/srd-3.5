EPIC MONSTERS (G-W)

#### 



#### GENIUS LOCI



## 

## 













































































![80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table01.png](80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table01.png)

A genius loci is difficult to spot, since it looks like any other section of landscape. A genius loci itself has no intelligence, but rather “emulates” the sentience of any creature it currently enslaves (see below), if any. Each genius loci has only a single enslaved creature at one time, though other creatures may also inhabit the surface of the genius loci. Any creature entering a genius loci who makes a successful Survival check (DC 31) realizes that something is amiss, though it is difficult to tell exactly what. Genius loci do not speak directly, though they may do so through their currently enslaved thrall.

## COMBAT

A genius loci can directly attack any creature standing on its surface with animated parts of itself, delivering slam attacks. It also directs its enslaved thrall against those it attacks. If its slave is slain, it selects another of its foes as its next, newest slave. Once a genius loci animates a portion of itself to attack the boundaries of its form become clear, and the creature becomes open to attack (Survival checks to determine the extent of the genius loci are no longer necessary). The animated part of the genius loci has a reach of 15 feet.

**Enslave (Su):** A genius loci can use the epic spellenslaveonce per round as a free action until it successfully enslaves a foe (Will DC 53 to resist). The DC is Charisma-based. Once it has a slave, it cannot enslave another until its current slave dies, isimprisoned, or is otherwise incapaticiated. A slave becomes free if its genius loci master is slain. A genius loci forces its slave to remain with it, though it may send its slave off to temporarily visit nearby locations in order to draw in unsuspecting victims. In fact, the “purposes” of the genius loci are to some degree influenced by the current slave. The genius loci has no Intelligence score of its own; thus, its emulation of its slave’s intelligence sometimes transfers attitudes and goals. However, a slave can only go so far in influencing its mobile master, and cannot knowingly attempt to free itself from the genius loci that keeps it close.

**Improved Grab (Ex):** If the genius loci hits a Gargantuan or smaller creature with a slam attack, it deals normal Damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. The genius loci has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use the part of its body it used in the improved grab to hold the opponent. Each successful grapple check it makes during successive rounds automatically deals slam attack Damage, in addition to constriction Damage.

**Constrict (Ex):** A genius loci crushes its opponent, dealing 4d10+30 points of bludgeoning Damage, after making a successful grapple check.

**Ooze Traits:** An ooze is an amorphous or mutable creature. Oozes are immune to poison,sleep,paralysis, stunning, and polymorphing. They have no clear front or back and are therefore not subject to critical hits or flanking. Oozes are blind but have the blindsight special quality. They have no Intelligence scores and are therefore immune to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects).





##### GIBBERING ORB



























































































![80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table02.png](80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table02.png)

A gibbering orb can speak all languages.

A gibbering orb’s natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

## COMBAT

The gibbering orb has the ability to bite its foes by extending a pseudopod with one of its mouths protruding from the end.The orb can extend four of these at any one foe, or a total of twelve in any given round. At the same time, the legions of eyes have the ability to cast a host of spells at a rapid rate.

**Gibbering (Su):** The cacophony of speech emanating from the scores of mouths that make up the orb forces all within 60 feet of the creature to succeed at a Will save each round (DC 40) or suffer the effects of aninsanityspell.

**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, the gibbering orb must hit with a bite attack. If it gets a hold, the orb automatically deals bite Damage and can attempt to swallow whole.

**Swallow Whole (Ex):** A gibbering orb can attempt to swallow a Large or smaller opponent by making a successful grapplecheck. Once inside, the opponent takes 4d8 points of constriction Damage plus 3d10 points of acid Damage per round. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using claws or a light slashing weapon to deal 20 points of Damage in a single blow (AC 16, DR 10/epic still applies). Once the creature exits, the fluidlike body structure of the orb closes the wound; other swallowed opponents must cut their own way out. When a creature dies by being swallowed whole (or when a creature killed by the gibbering orb in some other fashion is eaten by it), the gibbering orb absorbs the creature’s known spells, prepared spells, and spell-like abilities. The orb can use any two of those abilities per round as a free action. Each originates from an eye that is not producing an eye ray (see below) that round. Stolen spells and spell-like abilities are lost after 24 hours.

**Eye Rays (Su):** Two dozen of the eyes can each produce a magical ray each round, with each eye emulating a spell from among the list of spells below as if cast by a 27th-level caster. The save DCs, where applicable, are 16 + spell level. A gibbering orb has no directional limitations on where it can point its eye rays, because the eyes orbiting around its body drift and float wherever needed. However, a gibbering orb can never aim more than five rays at any single target, due to limitations of aiming. All rays have a range of 150 feet. Each of these effects functions as a ray, regardless of the normal parameters of the spell it resembles. That is, each is usable against a single target and requires a ranged touch attack. The eye rays are:cone of cold, disintegrate, dominate monster, energy drain, feeblemind, finger of death, flesh to stone, greater dispelling, harm, hold monster, horrid wilting, implosion, inflict critical wounds, lightning bolt, magic missile, mage’s disjunction, irresistible dance, polymorph any object, power word blind, power word kill, power word stun, prismatic spray, slay living,andtemporal stasis.

**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will—Two stolen spells or spell-like abilities per round. Caster level 27th, save DC 16 + spell level.

**All-Around Vision (Ex):** The gibbering orb’s many eyes give it a +4 racial bonus on Spot and Search checks.

**Flight (Ex):** The gibbering orb’s body is naturally buoyant. This buoyancy allows it to fly as the spell, as a free action, at a speed of 20 feet. This buoyancy also grants it a permanentfeather falleffect with personal range.

**Amorphous (Ex):** A gibbering orb is not subject to critical hits. It has no clear front or back, so it cannot be flanked.





##### GLOOM



























































































![80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table03.png](80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table03.png)

In the hand of any other creature but a gloom, the dagger is a+5 keen dagger.

A gloom’s natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

COMBAT

**Fear Gaze (Su):** Viewing the gloom’s face inspires terror. Creatures that meet the gloom’s gaze must succeed at a Will save (DC 32) or suffer the effects of afearspell as cast by a 20th-level caster. The DC is Charisma-based.

**Opportunist (Ex):** This ability functions like the rogue class feature of the same name.

**Sneak Attack (Ex):** A gloom is able to sneak attack as a 25th-level rogue, dealing 13d6 extra Damage.

**Quiescence (Su):** A gloom is constantly silent, as per thesilencespell, although the area does not extend beyond the creature itself. This quality gives it a +20 racial bonus on Move Silently checks (it is still possible for a gloom to create noise, such as by bumping into something that scrapes on the floor or by sounding a chime). The gloom can lower this effect at will.

**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will—shadow walk;3/day—true strike.Caster level 20th; save DC 20 + spell level. The DC is Charisma-based.





## GOLEM



































































































































![80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table04.png](80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table04.png)





## MITHRAL GOLEM

A mithral golem cannot speak or make any vocal noise, nor does it have any distinguishable odor. Unlike most golems, it can run just as well as a normal creature.

A mithral golem’s natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Combat

**Alacrity (Su):** Once per round, the mithral golem may take an extra standard action (either before or after its other actions in the round).

**Magic Immunity (Ex):** A mithral golem is immune to all magical and supernatural effects, except as follows. Aslowspell negates its alacrity for 1d4 rounds, while ahastespell restores 1d6 hit points per level of the caster (maximum 10d6) or restores its alacrity, if previously negated by aslowspell. Multipleslowspells simply extend the duration of the effect.

## Construction

A mithral golem’s body is sculpted from 8 1/2 tons of pure iron and is then polymorphed into mithral (usingpolymorph any object). A mithral golem costs 250,000 gold pieces to create, which includes 5,000 gp for the body. Assembling the body requires a successful Craft (armorsmithing) or Craft (weaponsmithing) check (DC 30). The creator must be 25th level, have the Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor feat, and be able to cast arcane spells. Completing the ritual drains 5,000 XP from the creator and requiresgeas/quest, haste,andwish.

An adamantine golem’s natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

**Trample (Ex):** As a standard action during its turn each round, the adamantine golem can literally run over an opponent at least one size category smaller than itself. The trample deals 8d10+30 points of bludgeoning Damage. Trampled opponents can either attempt attacks of opportunity at a –4 penalty or Reflex saves (DC 57) for half Damage. The DC is Strength-based.

**Magic Immunity (Ex):** An adamantine golem is immune to all magical and supernatural effects.

## Construction

An adamantine golem’s body is sculpted from 45,000 pounds of pure iron and is then polymorphed into adamantine (usingpolymorph any object).

The creator must be 30th level, have the Craft Epic Magic Arms and Armor feat, and be able to cast arcane spells. Completing the ritual drains 10,000 XP from the creator and requirescrushing hand, geas/quest,andwish.





##### HA-NAGA























































































![80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table05.png](80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table05.png)

A ha-naga’s natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

COMBAT

**Flight (Su):** As per theflyspell, 120 ft. (perfect). This ability gives the ha-naga a +6 circumstance bonus on Move Silently checks.

**Charming Gaze (Su):** Asmass charm monster,90 ft., Will save (DC 33). The DC is Charisma-based.

**Chameleon Ability (Ex):** Ha-nagas can blend in with their surroundings, giving them a +8 circumstance bonus on Hide checks.

HAGUNEMNON (PROTEAN)



























































































![80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table06.png](80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table06.png)

A hagunemnon’s natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

COMBAT

**Psionics (Sp):** At will—detect thoughts, dimension door, ethereal jaunt, knock, nondetection, plane shift, suggestion. Caster level 20th, save DC 22.

**Destabilize Form (Su):** If a protean hits with two or more slam attacks in the same round, it partly destabilizes its foe’s physical form, dealing an additional 4d6+31 points of Damage as well as 2 points of temporary Constitution Damage. If the victim is drained to 0 Constitution, its dead body is only so much clear fluid that drains away unless somehow preserved by friends of the victim.

**Alter Shape (Ex):** A protean can assume the shape of any combination of physical nondeific creatures at the same time as a free action. In fact, a protean’s form constantly boils, and it requires a move-equivalent action each round for a protean to maintain a certain shape (even if that shape is a combination of several shapes). Whatever its present form, the protean retains all its own special qualities. Plus, it gains the advantage of up to four extraordinary abilities from the forms it mimics (but not spell-like or supernatural powers). The assumed form can be no smaller than a flea and no larger than 200 feet in its largest dimension (make sure to take into account rules for reach and size modifiers to AC and melee attacks). Incorporeal traits can also be assumed, which counts as a single extraordinary ability. If a hagunemnon assumes a partial form that confers an extraordinary ability already possessed by the creature, only the better of the two abilities is retained. No matter its form, the protean can never make more than five attacks using a full-round action. However, it may substitute a melee attack form for one of its slam attacks, using its own base attack bonus and Strength modifier to Damage, but dealing base Damage appropriate to the attack type.





##### HOARY HUNTER















































































































































![80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table07.png](80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table07.png)

A hoary hunter’s natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

COMBAT

A critical hit (or the blow that would kill or render a foe unconscious) from the hoary hunter’s blade does not wound the hunter’s prey. Instead, the victim is bodily transported as per asoul bindingspell heightened to 16th level (DC 30) into a diamond at the end of the sword’s hilt.

**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will—discern location, true strike, fog cloud, hold monster, plane shift;3/day—dimensional anchor, dominate monster, greater dispel magic;1/day—mage’sdisjunction, contingent recall and resurrection*.Caster level 23rd; save DC 18 + spell level.*Contingent recall and resurrectionis a variation on an epic spell. When slain, the hoary hunter is actually transported, with its mount, back to the fey realm, where it is resurrected. The only way to truly slay the hoary hunter is to defeat it in its home realm after this epic spell has been exhausted for the day.





## HOARY STEED

A hoary steed’s natural weapons are treated as magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Combat

**Air Walk (Su):** A hoary steed can ride through the air as well as on the ground, as though affected by a permanentair walkspell.

**Astral Projection and Etherealness (Su):** These abilities function just like the spells of the same names as cast by a 20th-level caster.

##### HUNEFER



























































































![80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table08.png](80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table08.png)

Hunefers speak all spoken languages, though it takes one 1d4 rounds to switch between languages.

COMBAT

**Despair (Su):** The mere sight of a hunefer requires viewers to succeed at a Will saving throw (DC 48) or be paralyzed with fear for 1d4 rounds. Regardless of the outcome of the save, a subject is not again vulnerable to that hunefer’s despair ability for 24 hours. The DC is Charisma-based.

**Hunefer Rot (Su):** Supernatural disease—slam, Fort save (DC 35), incubation period instantaneous; Damage 1d6 temporary Con. Unlike normal diseases, hunefer rot requires a victim to make a successful saving throw every round or take another 1d6 points of temporary Constitution Damage. The rot continues until the victim reaches Constitution 0 (and dies) or receives aremove diseasespell or similar magic. An afflicted creature that dies shrivels away into sand unless bothremove diseaseandraise dead(or better) are cast on the remains within 2 rounds. If the remains are not so treated, on the third round the dust swirls and forms an 18 HD mummy with the dead foe’s equipment under the hunefer’s command. (Themummy dustepic spell has statistics for an 18 HD mummy.)

**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will—chain lightning, displacement, haste, knock, greater dispel magic, passwall, scrying, greater teleport, true seeing, unholy aura, weird;1/day—ruin(epic spell). Caster level 27th; save DC 23 + spell level. The DC is Charisma-based.

**Blazefire (Su):** Living creatures taking Damage from a lavawight’s attack find themselves ignited with blaze-fire; they must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 35) or permanently lose 4 hit points. The DC is Charisma-based. The opponent must continue to save every round for the next 6 rounds (7 rounds total) to avoid being permanently drained of 4 more hit points each round. The lavawight heals the same amount of Damage whenever a creature is drained of hit points, gaining any excess as temporary hit points. Tehse temporary hit points last a maximum of 1 hour. If an opponent is slain by blazefire, only blackened ash remains of the victim. Hit points lost to the blazefire never heal naturally and cannot be magically restored—they are gone for good.

**Fiery Hardness (Ex):** The lavawight’s molten skin provides it with Damage reduction of 10/–.





##### LEGENDARY ANIMAL









































































































































![80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table10.png](80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table10.png)

LEGENDARY BEAR

COMBAT

**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, a legendary bear must hit with a claw attack.

LEGENDARY TIGER

COMBAT

**Pounce (Ex):** If a legendary tiger leaps upon a foe during the first round of combat, it can make a full attack even if it has already taken a move action.

##### LESHAY



























































































![80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table11.png](80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table11.png)

A leshay’s natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

## COMBAT

**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will—alter self, detect thoughts, displacement, freedom, greater dispelling, heal, greater invisibility, knock, speak with plants, spell turning, greater teleport, water breathing.Caster level 28th; save DC 28 + spell level. The DCs are Charisma-based.

**LeShay Weapons (Su):** Each leShay carries two personal melee weapons that he or she manifests from his or her own life essence. The weapon can change form as he or she shifts from class to class, typically appearing as a bastard sword (one in each hand). When not in combat, the weapons simply do not exist, but leShay can “draw” their weapons from nowhere as a free action. LeShay weapons are considered light weapons for a leShay, regardless of their size.

**Superior Two-Weapon Fighting (Ex):** A leShay fights with a leShay weapon in each hand. Because these weapons are extensions of its own body, the leShay does not take an attack or Damage penalty for attacking with two weapons.

**Gaze (Su):** All creatures within 30 feet who meet the gaze of a leShay become affected as if bycharm monster. A Will save (DC 53) negates the effect. Each opponent within range of a gaze attack must attempt a saving throw each round at the beginning of his or her turn in the initiative order. A leShay can also actively gaze as an attack action by choosing a target within range, who must then attempt a saving throw. LeShay are immune to their own gaze. The DC is Charisma-based.

##### LIVING VAULT



















































































![80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table12.png](80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table12.png)

To access a vault, its creator must call the vault from where it is sequestered through the use of asendingspell. The vault has no obvious opening; however, items can be stored and retrieved by naming them (the living vault provides an inventory to its creator on request). The item to be stored appears to sink into the living vault’s form as if made of mud. Likewise, items retrieved pop out of the living vault’s form. Storing and retrieving items in this fashion takes one round per transaction. Creatures other than the vault’s master who wish to access the inventory must destroy the vault to do so. If a vault is destroyed, all the objects and creatures stored within immediately emerge.

A living vault’s natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

COMBAT

**Imprisonment** **(Sp):** As a free action twice per day, a living vault can project a 60-foot cone. Creatures caught in the cone must make a Will save (DC 58) or be affected as by theimprisonmentspell, except creatures are stored within the vault’s interior. The living vault can hold two Gargantuan creatures, eight Huge creatures, thirty-two Large creatures, one hundred twenty-eight Medium-size creatures, and so on. This assumes that the rest of the vault is also relatively empty, so a large hoard of treasure reduces the number of creatures a living vault can hold at any one time. Iffreedomis later cast upon the very spot where the victim ofimprisonmentdisappeared, the victim is freed, though it doesn’t appear where it disappeared, but in a space adjacent to wherever the living vault is currently physically located.

**Recognition (Ex):** Once made, a living vault responds only to its owner; no other being can access the vault’s interior. The vault is not fooled by disguised creatures, and can distinguish between its true master and false duplicates, even penetrating disguises used in conjunction withshapechange, alter self, disguise self, polymorph, seeming,andsimulacrumand similar effects. The vault does, however, respond to the product of aclonespell.

**Safekeeping** **(Sp):** At will, a living vault can use a power that combines the effects ofsequesterandplane shiftto render the vault invisible to any form of sight or divination, and at the same time transfer it to a random portion of the Astral Plane. When in safekeeping mode, the living vault responds to asendingby its master, returning to the location from which it left and becoming tangible once again. Creatures and objects that are stored within the vault are treated as if under the effects ofsequester,whether the vault itself is or not. Often, creatures are brought into the vault viaimprisonment,but sometimes unconscious or otherwise subdued creatures are stored as an object, in which case they receive no saving throw to resist the effect.

**Construct Traits:** Immune to mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects), and to poison,sleep,paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, necromantic effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects. Cannot heal Damage (though regeneration and fast healing still apply, if present). Not subject to critical hits, subdual Damage, ability Damage, ability drain, or energy drain. Not at risk of death from massive Damage, but destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points or less; cannot be raised or resurrected. Darkvision 60 ft.

**Magic Immunity (Ex):** A living vault is immune to all magical and supernatural effects, except as follows. Afreedomspell cast on it causes it to defer the use of its ownimprisonmentpower for 10 rounds.





##### MERCANE























































































![80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table13.png](80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table13.png)





Mercanes speak Abyssal, Celestial, Draconic, Infernal, and at least two other languages.

## COMBAT

**Spell-Like Abilities:** 3/day—dimension door, invisibility;1/day—secret chest, plane shift.Caster level 14th; save DC 12 + spell level.

**Telepathy (Su):** Mercanes can communicate telepathically with any creature within 100 feet that has a language.

**Skills:** Mercanes receive a +4 racial bonus on Appraise checks.





## MERCANE CHARACTERS

A mercane’s favored class is wizard. Player character mercanes have a level adjustment of +7.

##### 



##### MU SPORE



























































































![80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table14.png](80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table14.png)

Mu spores speak Common and Terran.

A mu spore’s natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

COMBAT

**Spore Cough (Su):** Once every 1d4 rounds a mu spore can release a cloud of burrowing spores. This spore cough is treated as a 100-foot-cone breath weapon. The burrowing spores deal 20d8 points of Damage to all creatures and structures in the area, or half Damage to any creatures that make a Reflex save (DC 36). The DC is Charisma-based.

**Improved Grab (Ex):** If a mu spore hits with a tendril, it deals normal Damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. Improved grab works only against Gargantuan and smaller opponents. The mu spore has the option to conduct the grapple normally, transfer the victim to its mouth as a free action, or simply use its tendril to hold the opponent. Each successful grapple check it makes during successive rounds automatically deals the Damage given for the tendril.

**Swallow Whole (Ex):** If the mu spore begins its turn with an opponent held in its mouth, it can attempt a new grapple check (as though attempting to pin the opponent). If it succeeds, it swallows its prey and the opponent takes bite Damage. A swallowed creature takes the twice the Damage given for the mu spore’s bite every round. A swallowed creature is considered grappled, while the creature that did the swallowing is not. A swallowed creature can try to cut its way free with any light piercing or slashing weapon, if it can deal 33 points of Damage in this fashion, or it can just try to escape the grapple. If the swallowed creature chooses the latter course, success puts it back in the mu spore’s mouth, where it may be bitten or swallowed again.

**Sticky (Ex):** Sticky tendrils cover a mu spore, many more than the four main tendrils it uses for combat. Any creature that touches or successfully attacks a mu spore with a melee weapon is subject to a free improved grab check by the mu spore, as if the mu spore had success-fully attacked the creature with a tendril. A creature wielding a melee weapon must immediately relinquish its grip on its weapon, or proceed with the grapple check. If the subject relinquishes its grip on its weapon, the weapon is swallowed the following round. Creatures who attack the mu spore in melee without a weapon they can release (such as those with natural attacks only) do not have this option.

**Plant Traits:** Immune to poison,sleep,paralysis, stunning, and polymorphing; not subject to critical hits or mind-affecting effects.





NEH-THALGGU (BRAIN COLLECTOR)



























































































![80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table15.png](80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table15.png)

A creature whose brain has been harvested by a brain collector cannot be raised, reincarnated, or resurrected while the brain is in the creature, because the collector preserves and draws upon the soul and basic personality of the creature for as long as it retains the brain. Neh-thalggus’ own language is a silent sign language “spoken” with their writhing head-tentacles. They can also communicate telepathically with any creature that has a language within 100 feet.

A neh-thalggu’s natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

COMBAT

**Poison (Ex):** A neh-thalggu’s bite injects a debilitating poison (DC 32) that Damages the victim’s Constitution. He or she loses half his or her current Constitution immediately on a failed save and must save again 1 minute later or lose half of his or her remaining Constitution. If the character survives, he or she heals the ability Damage at the normal rate (1 point per day).The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Head-Tentacles (Ex):** The long, whiplike tentacles that frame either side of a brain collector’s face can deliver a dangerous touch attack that, if successful, causes the target to dehydrate and wither (2d10 points of desiccation Damage). In addition, each successful tentacle attack drains 1 point of Strength, 1 point of Dexterity, and 1 point of Constitution. This is permanent ability drain and may only be reversed by spells such asrestorationandgreater restoration. It can bring all ten tentacles to bear on a single target facing it or divide its attacks against up to ten targets that it threatens.

**Extract Brains** **(Sp):** Once every 1d4 rounds, as a full-round action, a brain collector can extract the brain from a target creature in line of sight. This attack is psionic in nature and can be blocked by adimensional anchorcurrently in force on thetarget. The target gets a Will save (DC 31) to resist the extraction. The save DC is Intelligence-based. If the save fails, his orher brain is drawn out intact through the skull by extradimensional means and sucked up by the brain collector, lodging in an unused storage sac above and behind its eyes. If the save succeeds, he or she takes 9d6 points of Damage and is stunned for 1d4+1 rounds. A brain collector prefers to absorb brains of high-level arcane spellcasters but is fully capable of extracting those of other foes as a highly effective attack. When encountered, assume a neh-thalggu has a full retinue of thirteen stolen brains. Each brain less than the full thirteen bestows one negative level on the neh-thalggu (though these never convert to actual level loss), which is a powerful incentive for the creature to always keep its brain-sacs filled. A neh-thalggu is free to draw on all the Knowledge skills of each brain it currently stores, using the base ranks in a skill possessed by each brain, and adjusted by the neh-thalggu’s own skill modifiers for the Knowledge skill in question (or its Intelligence modifier, for a skill it has no ranks in).

**Dimensional Travel** **(Sp):** A brain collector’s preferred method of locomotion is viadimension door,which it can do as a quickened action, once per round. It can also useteleport without errororplane shiftat will as a move-equivalent action.

**Spells (Sp):** A fully grown brain collector can cast arcane spells as a 13th-level sorcerer (one level of spell-casting ability per brain).

**Incorporeal:** A neh-thalggu is not wholly in our reality but always remains partially extradimensional. Thus it can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, +1 or better weapons, magic, or psionics, with a 50% chance to ignore any Damage from a corporeal source. It can pass through solid objects at will, and its own attacks pass through armor (except for its bite attack, which is treated as if a corporeal attack). It always moves silently unless it chooses otherwise.

**Amorphous Physiology (Ex):** A brain collector does not have fixed organs. As such, it is immune to critical hits, death from massive Damage, sneak attacks, and coup de grace.

**Manifest Maw:** Though it is an incorporeal creature, a neh-thalggu can manifest its mouth in corporeal form as a standard action. While so manifested, the mouth can deliver bite attacks against corporeal creatures or pick up objects. The mouth bites as if it had Str 35.

**Feats:** A neh-thalggu gains Power Attack as a bonus feat, even though it has no Strength score.

##### PRISMASAURUS



























































































![80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table16.png](80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table16.png)

COMBAT

**Prismatic Emanations (Su):** The reflected and refracted light from the prismasaurus’s crystalline ridge functions very similarly to theprismatic sprayspell. Any creature of less than 8 HD that is within 30 feet of the creature is automatically blinded for 2d4 rounds. In addition, any creature within 20 feet of the prismasaurus is randomly struck by one or more rays of light, as determined by the table that accompanies theprismatic sprayspell.This effect is as theprismatic sprayspell in a 30-foot-radius spread, but is otherwise as cast by a 20th-level caster. The save DC for theprismatic sprayeffects is 49.

**Immunities (Su):** It is immune to poison, gases, petrification, and mind-affecting attacks.

**Prismatic Blur (Ex):** The reflected and refracted light that constantly surrounds the creature blurs the creature’s outline and makes it difficult to properly target. All melee and ranged attacks against the creature have a 50% miss chance.





##### PSEUDONATURAL TROLL























































































![80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table17.png](80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table17.png)

A pseudotroll’s natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

COMBAT

**Constant Insight (Su):** A pseudotroll makes all its attacks (including grapples) with a +15 insight bonus (calculated into the above statistics). The creature is not affected by the miss chance that applies to attacks against a concealed target.

**Improved Grab (Ex):** If a pseudonatural troll hits an opponent smaller than it with a tentacle, it deals normal Damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.

**Rend (Ex):** If a pseudotroll hits with two or more tentacle rake attacks, it latches onto the opponent’s body and tears the flesh. This attack automatically deals an additional 4d8+25 points of Damage, and can be used concurrently with its improved grab ability.

**Rotting Constriction (Ex):** Once a pseudotroll has hold of an opponent, each successful grapple check it makes during subsequent rounds automatically drains 2d4 points of Constitution. At the same time, the pseudotroll regains 10 lost hit points.

**Regeneration (Ex):** Fire and acid deal normal Damage to a pseudotroll. If a pseudotroll loses a tentacle or body part, the lost portion regrows in 1 minute. The creature can reattach the severed member instantly by holding it to the stump.

**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will—blur, dimension door, shield, unhallow.Caster level 20th; save DC 8 + spell level. The DC is Charisma-based.

**Alternate Form (Su):** At will, a pseudotroll can take the form of a grotesque, tentacled mass (or another appropriately gruesome form), but all its abilities remain unchanged despite the alien appearance. Changing shape is a standard action. Other creatures receive a –1 morale penalty on their attack rolls against a pseudotroll in this alternate form.





## CREATING A PSEUDONATURAL CREATURE

“Pseudonatural” is a template that can be added to any corporeal creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature).

These tentacle attacks always use the creature’s best attack bonus. It also gains additional tentacle rake attacks (also at its best attack bonus) as noted on the table below.

**Damage:** Tentacle rakes from a pseudonatural creature deal Damage equal to 2d8 + Str modifier.

**Special Attacks:** A pseudonatural creature retains all the special attacks of the base creature and also gains the following.

**Constant Insight (Su):** The creature makes all its attacks with a +15 insight bonus. The creature is not affected by the miss chance that applies to attacks against a concealed target.

If the creature already has one or more of these special qualities, use the better value.

**Alternate Form (Su):** At will, a pseudonatural creature can take the form of a grotesque, tentacled mass (or another appropriately gruesome form), but all its abilities remain unchanged despite the alien appearance. Changing shape is a standard action. Other creatures receive a –1 morale penalty on their attack rolls against pseudonatural creatures in this alternate form.

###### RUIN SWARM























































































![80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table19.png](80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table19.png)

Combat

**Blinding (Ex):** Any living creature that begins its turn with a ruin swarm in its space must make a Fortitude save (DC 51) or be blinded for one round. The save DC is Dexterity-based.

**Blindsense (Ex):** The ruin swarm notices and locates creatures within 200 ft. Opponents still have 100% concealment against the swarm (but swarm attacks ignore concealment).

**Distraction (Ex):** Any living creature vulnerable to the swarm’s damage that begins its turn with a swarm in its square is nauseated for 1 round; a DC 45 Fortitude save negates the effect. Even with a successful save, spellcasting or concentrating on spells within the area of a swarm requires a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level). Using skills requiring patience and concentration requires a Concentration check (DC 20). The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Swarm Traits:** A swarm has no clear front or back and no discernable anatomy, so it is not subject to critical hits or flanking. A swarm made up of Tiny creatures takes half damage from

slashing and piercing weapons.

Reducing a swarm to 0 hit points or fewer causes the swarm to break up, though damage taken until that point does not degrade its ability to attack or resist attack. Swarms are never staggered or reduced to a dying state by damage. Also, they cannot be tripped, grappled, or bull rushed, and they cannot grapple another.

A swarm is immune to any spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such asdisintegrate), with the exception of mind-affecting effects if the swarm has an intelligence score and a hive mind. A swarm takes a –10 penalty on saving throws against spells or effects that affect an area, such as many evocation spells or grenadelike weapons. If the area effect attack does not allow a saving throw, the swarm takes double damage instead.

A swarm rendered unconscious by means of subdual damage becomes disorganized and dispersed, and does not re-form until its hit points exceed its subdual damage.

**Vermin Traits:** A ruin swarm is immune to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects). It also has darkvision (60-foot range).





##### SHADOW OF THE VOID



























































































![80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table20.png](80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table20.png)

A shadow of the void’s natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Combat

**Blightfire (Su):** Living creatures taking Damage from a shadow of the void’s incorporeal touch attack find themselves ignited with blightfire; cold, black flames cascade over their bodies, and they must succeed at a Fort save (DC 37) or permanently lose 6 points of Constitution. The opponent must continue to save every round for the next 6 rounds (7 rounds total) to avoid being permanently drained of 6 more Con points. The creature heals 30 points of Damage whenever it drains 6 points of Constitution, gaining any excess as temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last a maximum of 1 hour. If the opponent is slain by blight-fire, only icy fragments of the victim remain, until they reform as a winterwight. The save DC is Charisma-dased.

**Create Spawn (Su):** Any humanoid slain by a shadow of the void becomes a winterwight in 1d4 rounds. Winterwights are under the command of the shadow of the void that created them and remain enslaved until its death. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life, though they do possess general knowledge of the slain creature. This knowledge is used for evil purposes, if possible.

**Spell-Like Abilities:** 3/day—deeper darkness, freezing sphere.Caster level 24th; save DC 20 + spell level. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Incorporeal Traits:** Can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons, or magic, with a 50% chance to ignore any Damage from a corporeal source. Can pass through solid objects at will, and own attacks pass through armor. Always moves silently.

**Undead Traits:** Immune to poison,sleep,paralysis, stunning, disease, death, effects, necromantic effects, mind-affecting effects, and any effect requiring a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects. Not subject to critical hits, subdual Damage, ability Damage, ability drain, or energy drain. Negative energy heals. Not at risk of death from massive Damage, but destroyed at 0 hit points or less. Darkvision 60 ft. Cannot be raised; resurrection works only if creature is willing.

**Cold Subtype:** Immunity to cold. Vulnerability to fire, (takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from fire, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure).

**Cold Aura (Su):** A 10-foot-radius spread cold aura surrounds a shadow of the void. All creatures of the cold sub-type in the area (including the shadow of the void) are treated as if having turn resistance +6 (if undead) and fast healing 10. Creatures subject to cold Damage take 2d10 points of cold Damage each round they remain within the cold aura.





##### SHAPE OF FIRE



























































































![80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table21.png](80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table21.png)

A shape of fire’s natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

COMBAT

**Blazefire (Su):** Living creatures taking Damage from a shape of fire’s incorporeal touch attack find them-selves ignited with blazefire; white-hot, lambent flames cascade over their bodies, and they must succeed at a Fort save (DC 37) or permanently lose 10 hit points. The opponent must continue to save every round for the next 6 rounds (7 rounds total) to avoid being permanently drained of 10 more hit points each round. The shape of fire heals the same amount of Damage whenever a creature is drained, gaining any excess hit points as temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last a maximum of 1 hour. If the opponent is slain by blazefire, only blackened ash remains of the victim. Hit points lost to the blazefire never heal naturally and cannot be magically restored—they are gone for good. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Create Spawn (Su):** Any humanoid slain by a shape of fire becomes a lavawight in 1d4 rounds. Lavawights are under the command of the shape of fire that created them and remain enslaved until its death. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.

**Spell-Like Abilities:** 3/day—fire storm, incendiary cloud.Caster level 24th; save DC 20 + spell level. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Incorporeal Traits:** Can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons, or magic, with a 50% chance to ignore any Damage from a corporeal source. Can pass through solid objects at will, and own attacks pass through armor. Always moves silently.

**Undead Traits:** Immune to poison,sleep,paralysis, stunning, disease, death, effects, necromantic effects, mind-affecting effects, and any effect requiring a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects. Not subject to critical hits, subdual Damage, ability Damage, ability drain, or energy drain. Negative energy heals. Not at risk of death from massive Damage, but destroyed at 0 hit points or less. Darkvision 60 ft. Cannot be raised; resurrection works only if creature is willing.

**Fire Subtype:** Immunity to fire. Vulnerability to cold (takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from cold, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure).

**Heat Aura (Su):** A 10-foot-radius spread heat aura surrounds a shape of fire. All creatures of the fire subtype in the area (including the shape of fire) are treated as if having turn resistance +6 (if undead) and fast healing 10. Creatures subject to fire Damage take 2d10 points of fire Damage each round they remain within the heat aura.





##### SIRRUSH



























































































![80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table22.png](80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table22.png)





##### THREE-HEADED SIRRUSH



























































































![80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table23.png](80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table23.png)

Sirrushes speak Sylvan and Draconic.

A sirrush’s natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

COMBAT

**Stunning Roar (Ex):** Every 1d4 rounds, a sirrush can loose a sonic attack of such volume that it stuns all creatures in a 60-foot spread for 1d4 rounds if they fail a Fortitude saving throw (DC 47, or DC 51 for a three-headed sirrush). The DC is

**Pounce (Ex):** If a sirrush charges or leaps upon a foe during its first round of combat, it can make a full attack even if it has already taken a move action.

**Headloss Resistance (Ex):** A sirrush’s thick bony plate protects its neck like a shield and provides resistance from effects that could normally behead it, such as a vorpal weapon. When a sirrush or three-headed sir-rush would otherwise lose its head, it instead makes a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 HD of attacker + attacker’s Str modifier). On a failed save, the sirrush’s head leaves its shoulders normally, but on a successful save, the sirrush is unaffected by the beheading. A sirrush dies when beheaded; a three-headed sirrush goes on fighting until all its heads are lost (the only penalty it incurs is one or two fewer bite attacks when it makes a full attack).





##### TAYELLAH



























































































![80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table24.png](80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table24.png)

A tayellah’s natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

COMBAT

**Poison (Ex):** Sting, Fort save (DC 39); initial and secondary Damage 2d10 temporary Con. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Pounce (Ex):** If a tayellah leaps upon a foe during the first round of combat, it can make a full attack even if it has already taken a move action.

**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, the tayellah must hit with two of its claw attacks. If it gets a hold, it can rake.

**Rake (Ex):** A tayellah that gets a hold can make two additional rake attacks (+44 melee) with legs it normally only uses for walking, dealing 4d6+5 points of Damage each. If the tayellah pounces on an opponent, it can also rake.





##### THORCIASID



























































































![80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table25.png](80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table25.png)

Thorciasids speak Common, Elven, Dwarven, and Giant.

A thorciasid’s natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

COMBAT

**Cocoon (Ex):** A thorciasid can eject a stream of noxious goo that hardens on contact, potentially fixing a subject in place and hindering its movement and actions. Using a standard action, the thorciasid makes a ranged touch attack against any foe it can see up to 60 feet away. If it succeeds at the ranged touch attack, the subject makes a grapple check against the cocoon. This is accomplished as if the thorciasid itself were making the grapple check with a competence bonus of +10, for a total check modifier of +37. On a failed check for the subject, the goo hardens into a partial cocoon, and the victim is treated as if grappled (even though the thorciasid is free to do as it desires). The subject can attempt to break the grapple of the cocoon (or use Escape Artist) each round, making an opposed grapple check against the cocoon (check modifier +37 for the cocoon). A thorciasid can reinforce a partial cocoon by spending a standard action secreting additional goo. Each action so spent provides an additional +5 to the cocoon’s grapple check modifier. Visually, the victim becomes more and more covered and is finally com-pletely encased in a cocoon. Even fully encased victims can still breathe, and a thorciasid can drain a victim’s life force at its leisure.

**Ability Drain (Su):** On a successful melee touch attack with a forelimb, the thorciasid permanently drains 1d4+1 points of Strength, 1d4+1 points of Dexterity, and 1 point of Constitution from the victim. The thorciasid regains 20 lost hit points with each successful ability drain.

**Energy Drain (Su):** On a successful melee touch attack with an antenna, the thorciasid gives the victim one negative level. Each negative level bestowed upon a victim gives the thorciasid +1 bonus to its Constitution that lasts for 24 hours. The negative levels similarly last for 24 hours, at which time the victim must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 34) to avoid level loss. The save DC is Charisma-based.





##### TITAN,ELDER



























































































![80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table26.png](80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table26.png)

An elder titan’s natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

He will also possess the knowledge of at least three epic spells and the means by which to develop them, though he may not have done so himself.





##### TREANT,ELDER



































































































![80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table27.png](80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table27.png)

Elder treants speak the language of treants, plus Common and Sylvan.

COMBAT

**Animate Trees** **(Sp):** An elder treant can animate trees within 500 feet at will, controlling up to six trees at a time. It takes a full round for a normal tree to uproot itself. Thereafter it moves and fights as a treant in all physical respects. Animated trees lose their ability to move if the elder treant who animated them is incapacitated or moves out of range.

**Trample (Ex):** An elder treant can trample Gargantuan or smaller creatures for 8d20+40 points of Damage. Opponents who do not make attacks of opportunity against the elder treant can attempt a Reflex save (DC 54) to halve the Damage. The save DC is Strength-based.

**Triple Damage against Objects (Ex):** An elder treant that makes a full attack against an object or structure deals triple Damage.

**Plant Traits:** Immune to poison,sleep,paralysis, stunning, and polymorphing; not subject to critical hits or mind-affecting effects.

**Skills:** Elder treants receive skills as though they were fey. *They have a +24 racial bonus on Hide checks made in forested areas.

UMBRAL BLOT (BLACKBALL)



























































































![80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table28.png](80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table28.png)

COMBAT

**Disintegrating Touch (Ex):** Any material object that comes into contact with a blackball is immediately disintegrated unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save (DC 38). A character or object that has been disintegrated by an umbral blot disappears completely, leaving behind not even dust to mark its passing. Those who make a successful saving throw still take 5d6 points of Damage from the disintegrating touch. Likewise, weapons or objects that save take a like amount of Damage. (Remember, tended or held objects save with the same bonus as their owners.)

**Vortex (Ex):** Normally a blackball insulates itself somehow from the air around it (otherwise it would perpetually be at the center of a howling wind-storm). If it chooses, instead of allowing the air to bend around it, the blackball can suspend this insulation, causing a sudden rush of wind to pour toward the blackball from all directions. This vortex sucks all the air from a 30-foot-by-30-foot-by-30-foot room in a single round, creating a sudden influx of air in its direction. All flying or floating creatures within 30 feet of the umbral blot who fail a Reflex save (DC 38) are swept along with the wind into contact with the blackball. Nonflying creatures within 30 feet who fail a Reflex save (DC 19) are pulled into contact with the umbral blot. Contact with an umbral blot could lead to disintegration, as noted above.

**Spell Immunities (Ex):** In addition to the spells that an umbral blot is immune to because of its construct traits, it is immune todisintegrationspells and variations thereof.

**Planar Travel (Ex):** A blackball can fold space at will, allowing it to useethereal jaunt, dimension door, greater teleport,orplane shiftat will as a standard action.

**Construct Traits:** Immune to mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects), and to poison,sleep,paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, necromantic effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects. Cannot heal Damage (though regeneration and fast healing still apply, if present). Not subject to critical hits, subdual Damage, ability Damage, ability drain, or energy drain. Not at risk of death from massive Damage, but destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points or less; cannot be raised or resurrected. Darkvision 60 ft.





##### UVUUDAUM



























































































![80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table29.png](80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table29.png)

Uvuudaums can speak telepathically to any creature within 500 feet that has a language.

A uvuudaum’s natural weapons are treated as epic and evil for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

COMBAT

**Confusion Aura (Su):** This ability operates continuously, as theconfusionspell but with a 30-foot radius. Potential victims can make a Will save (DC 47) to resist confusion. Those affected by the aura can make a new save every 4 rounds to throw off the effect. Once it has successfully resisted, a subject remains immune to that uvuudaum’s confusion aura for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Wisdom Drain (Su):** This effect permanently reduces a living opponent’s Wisdom score by 2d4 points when the creature hits with its head spike, or twice that amount on a critical hit. The creature regains 5 lost hit points (or 10 on a critical hit ) whenever it drains Wisdom, gaining any excess hit points as temporary hit points. Thesse temporary hit points last a maximum of 1 hour. An opponent can avoid the Wisdom drain with a Fortitude save (DC 47). The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will—confusion, dimension door, greater dispel magic, displacement, haste, invisibility, lightning bolt, magic missile, mage armor, polymorph, shield, stoneskin, true strike, web;3/day—chain lightning, cone of cold, disintegrate, dominate person, plane shift, prismatic spray, scrying, greater teleport, wall of force;1/day—contingent resurrection, nailed to the sky, time duplicate(epic spells),time stop.Caster level 27th; save DC 28 + spell level. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

**Regeneration (Ex):** Uvuudaums take normal damage from holy weapons, cold, and fire.





##### VERMIURGE

A vermiurge’s natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

COMBAT

**Aura of Doom (Su):** A vermiurge is constantly affected as if by acrown of verminspell (epic spell) cast by a 42nd-level caster. As per the spell, a vermiurge may completely suppress the aura of insects as desired. A vermiurge’s aura of doom constantly replenishes itself at a rate of 200 vermin per round (unlimited duration). When vermin die off either by being slain or by dealing Damage to another creature, the aura does not permanently collapse, even if all the vermin are slain or if all 1,000 vermin deal their Damage in 1 round. As soon as any vermin are replenished, they participate normally in thecrown of vermineffect.

**Concealing Aura (Ex):** Its aura of doom constantly provides a vermiurge with nine-tenths concealment, so all attacks made against it have a 40% miss chance.

**Frightful Presence (Su):** This ability takes effect automatically when the vermiurge first engages its aura of doom. It affects only opponents with fewer Hit Dice or levels than the creature has. The affected creature must make a successful Will save (DC 48) or become shaken. Success indicates that the target is immune to that creature’s frightful presence for one day. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Poison (Ex):** Sting or bite, Fort save (DC 44); initial Damage 1d6 temporary Con, secondary Damage 2d6 temporary Con. The save DC is Constitution-based.

![80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table31.png](80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table31.png)

Winterwights speak Common and Infernal.

A winterwight’s natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

COMBAT

**Rend (Ex):** If the winterwight hits with both of its claws, it latches onto the opponent’s body and tears the flesh. This attack automatically deals an additional 6d8+31 points of Damage.

**Blightfire (Su):** When a winterwight deals Damage to a living opponent, a night-black flame begins to burn on the opponent’s body. If the opponent fails a Fortitude save (DC 35), it takes 4 points of permanent Constitution drain. The opponent must continue to save every round for the next 4 rounds (5 rounds total) to avoid being permanently drained of an additional 4 points of Constitution per round. The creature regains 10 lost hit points whenever it drains 4 points of Constitution, gaining any excess hit points as temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last a maximum of 1 hour. If the opponent is slain by blightfire, only icy fragments of the victim remain. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will—cone of cold, control weather, dimension door, spell immunity (fireball),sleet storm(a winterwight is immune to the effects of asleet stormspell),wall of ice. Caster level 23rd; save DC 19 + spell level. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

Not subject to critical hits, subdual Damage, ability Damage, ability drain, or energy drain. Negative energy heals. Not at risk of death from massive Damage, but destroyed at 0 hit points or less. Darkvision 60 ft. Cannot be raised; resurrection works only if creature is willing.

**Cold Subtype:** Immunity to cold. Vulnerability to fire (takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from fire, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure).

**Cold Aura (Su):** A 10-foot-radius spread cold aura surrounds a winterwight. All creatures of the cold sub-type in the field (including the winterwight) are treated as if having turn resistance +6 (if undead) and fast healing 10. Creatures subject to cold Damage take 2d10 points of cold Damage each round they remain within the cold aura.





##### WORM THAT WALKS























































































![80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table32.png](80 EpicMonsters(G-W)-Table32.png)

A worm that walks rarely speaks, although it retains knowledge of all languages it knew in life, as well as any it has learned since.

COMBAT

**Spells:** A worm that walks can cast any spells it could cast as a character. This sample worm was a 23rd-level wizard (spells per day: 4/12/6/6/6/5/5/5/5/4/1/1). The last spell slots are 10th-level and 11th-level slots, respectively, and are available for 0–9th level meta-magic spells.

**Spell-Like Abilities:** 1/day—animal growth(vermin),animal messenger(vermin),animal shapes(vermin),animal trance(vermin),colossal vermin(asgiant vermin, but it can increase the creature’s size from Large to Gargantuan and from Huge to Colossal),creeping doom, giant vermin, summon swarm(vermin),summon vermin(assummon nature’s ally,except it summons 10 HD of vermin per level), andvermin plague(asinsect plague). Caster level 20th; save DC 9 + spell level. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

**Engulf (Ex):** A worm that walks can choose to engulf an opponent who is no more than one size category larger than itself. The worm attempts to embrace its victim, and with a successful melee touch attack, the victim is immediately swallowed up and surrounded by a mass of vermin, taking 100 points of damage. A victim who spends a full-round action can break free of the embrace and move up to half its speed away from the worm if desired, but can do nothing else. Otherwise, each round a victim remains embraced, it takes another 100 points of Damage. Constructs are immune to this attack.

**Spells:** The worm that walks can cast any spells it could cast when a living character. It also gains several related abilities.

**Frightful Presence (Su):** When a worm that walks engulfs a victim, witnesses must make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the worm’s HD + the worm’s Cha modifier). Those who make the save are shaken. Those who fail by 5 or fewer points are frightened. Those who fail by 6 to10 points are panicked. Those who fail by 11 or more points are cowering. All these conditions last for 1d4 rounds. Those who have seen a worm use this attack before gain a +5 bonus on their saving throws. The victim of the worm’s engulf attack has a –5 penalty on his or her saving throw.

**Discorporate (Ex):** If gravely threatened, a worm can discorporate as a free action, simply falling into a pile of individual vermin that slither quickly away. So long as any of the component vermin survive, they can breed and create a new body to house the wizard’s intelligence and personality. Discorporating is a dangerous tactic, because once separated, the vermin are treated no differently than other vermin. Also, the worm stands a good chance of losing all its equipment. However, discorporation almost assures that at least one maggot (if not dozens) will manage to crawl away, and so provide for theworm’s continued existence.

**Immunities (Ex):** A worm that walks has no discernable anatomy, so it is not subject to critical hits or flanking.

**Possessions:** Scrolls offireball(10th-level caster), greaterteleport, acid fog, incendiary cloud, shapechange, wail of thebanshee, clenched fist, horrid wilting, maze, summon monster IX;potions of cure serious wounds, alter self, haste, fly.Other magic gear:amulet of natural armor +2, bracers of armor +8, ring of protection +3, +4 staff,rod of absorption, gloves of Dexterity +4, headband of intellect +6, pink Ioun stone, wings of flying.

## WORM THAT WALKS CHARACTERS

By making eldritch preparations on a burial plot, a powerful spellcaster can improve the likelihood of a worm that walks emerging from the ground. The body is buried in an elaborate ritual that, the spellcaster hopes, will attract a critical mass of worms or maggots. The spellcaster performing the ritual must spend 10,000 gp in rare reagents for the ceremony. Furthermore, the ritual drains 2,000 XP from the spell-caster and requires the following spells:limited wish, polymorph any object, summon swarm(heightened to 7th level),andsympathy.Even if the ritual is performed correctly, there is only a chance that the deceased spellcaster will arise as a worm that walks. For each prepared but uncast arcane spell the deceased had at the moment of death (or unused spell slots if a spontaneous caster), there’s a 1% chance that a worm that walks will slither from the grave soil in 1d4 days. Some worms that walk arise spontaneously from ordinary burial plots, but such an event is exceedingly rare. And an epic spell can create worms that walk every time without fail.
