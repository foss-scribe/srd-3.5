{\LARGE{}MAGIC ITEMS II (ARMOR \& WEAPONS)}

\vspace{12pt}
ARMOR

In general, magic armor protects the wearer to a greater extent than nonmagical 
armor. Magic armor bonuses are enhancement bonuses, never rise above +5, and stack 
with regular armor bonuses (and with shield and magic shield enhancement bonuses). 
All magic armor is also masterwork armor, reducing armor check penalties by 1.

In addition to an enhancement bonus, armor may have special abilities. Special 
abilities usually count as additional bonuses for determining the market value 
of an item, but do not improve AC. A suit of armor cannot have an effective bonus 
(enhancement plus special ability bonus equivalents) higher than +10. A suit of 
armor with a special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.

A suit of armor or a shield may be made of an unusual material. Roll d\%: 01-95 
indicates that the item is of a standard sort, and 96-100 indicates that it is 
made of a special material.

Armor is always created so that even if the type of armor comes with boots or gauntlets, 
these pieces can be switched for other magic boots or gauntlets.

\vspace{12pt}
\textbf{Caster Level for Armor and Shields:} The caster level of a magic shield 
or magic armor with a special ability is given in the item description. For an 
item with only an enhancement bonus, the caster level is three times the enhancement 
bonus. If an item has both an enhancement bonus and a special ability, the higher 
of the two caster level requirements must be met.

\textbf{Shields:} Shield enhancement bonuses stack with armor enhancement bonuses. 
Shield enhancement bonuses do not act as attack or damage bonuses when the shield 
is used in a bash. The bashing special ability, however, does grant a +1 bonus 
on attack and damage rolls (see the special ability description).

A shield could be built that also acted as a magic weapon, but the cost of the 
enhancement bonus on attack rolls would need to be added into the cost of the shield 
and its enhancement bonus to AC.

As with armor, special abilities built into the shield add to the market value 
in the form of additions to the bonus of the shield, although they do not improve 
AC. A shield cannot have an effective bonus (enhancement plus special ability bonus 
equivalents) higher than +10. A shield with a special ability must have at least 
a +1 enhancement bonus.

\textbf{Shield Hardness and Hit Points:} Each +1 of enhancement bonus adds 2 to 
a shield's hardness and +10 to its hit points.

\textbf{Activation:} Usually a character benefits from magic armor and shields 
in exactly the way a character benefits from nonmagical armor and shields---by 
wearing them. If armor or a shield has a special ability that the user needs to 
activate then the user usually needs to utter the command word (a standard action).

\textbf{Armor for Unusual Creatures: }The cost of armor for nonhumanoid creatures, 
as well as for creatures who are neither Small nor Medium, varies\textit{. }The 
cost of the masterwork quality and any magical enhancement remains the same.

Magic Armor and Shield Special Ability Descriptions

Most magic armor and shields only have enhancement bonuses. Such items can also 
have one or more of the special abilities detailed below. Armor or a shield with 
a special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.

\textbf{Acid Resistance:} A suit of armor or a shield with this property normally 
has a dull gray appearance. The armor absorbs the first 10 points of acid damage 
per attack that the wearer would normally take (similar to the \textit{resist energy 
}spell).

Faint abjuration; CL 3rd; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{resist energy; }Price 
+18,000 gp.

\textbf{Acid Resistance, Improved:} As acid resistance, except it absorbs the first 
20 points of acid damage per attack.

Moderate abjuration; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{resist energy; 
}Price +42,000 gp.

\textbf{Acid Resistance, Greater:} As acid resistance, except it absorbs the first 
30 points of acid damage per attack.

Moderate abjuration; CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{resist energy; 
}Price +66,000 gp.

\textbf{Animated:} Upon command, an animated shield floats within 2 feet of the 
wielder, protecting her as if she were using it herself but freeing up both her 
hands. Only one shield can protect a character at a time. A character with an animated 
shield still takes any penalties associated with shield use, such as armor check 
penalty, arcane spell failure chance, and nonproficiency.

Strong transmutation\textit{; }CL 12th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{animate 
objects; }Price +2 bonus.

\textbf{Arrow Catching:} A shield with this ability attracts ranged weapons to 
it. It has a deflection bonus of +1 against ranged weapons because projectiles 
and thrown weapons veer toward it. Additionally, any projectile or thrown weapon 
aimed at a target within 5 feet of the shield's wearer diverts from its original 
target and targets the shield's bearer instead. (If the wielder has total cover 
relative to the attacker, the projectile or thrown weapon is not diverted.) Additionally, 
those attacking the wearer with ranged weapons ignore any miss chances that would 
normally apply. Projectiles and thrown weapons that have an enhancement bonus higher 
than the shield's base AC bonus are not diverted to the wearer (but the shield's 
increased AC bonus still applies against these weapons). The wielder can activate 
or deactivate this ability with a command word.

Moderate abjuration; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{entropic shield}; 
Price +1 bonus.

\textbf{Arrow Deflection:} This shield protects the wielder as if he had the Deflect 
Arrows feat. Once per round when he would normally be struck by a ranged weapon, 
he can make a DC 20 Reflex save. If the ranged weapon has an enhancement bonus, 
the DC increases by that amount. If he succeeds, the shield deflects the weapon. 
He must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed. Attempting to deflect a ranged 
weapon doesn't count as an action. Exceptional ranged weapons, such as boulders 
hurled by giants or \textit{acid arrows}, can't be deflected.

Faint abjuration\textit{; }CL 5th\textit{; }Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{shield; 
}Price +2 bonus.

\textbf{Bashing:} A shield with this special ability is designed to perform a shield 
bash. A bashing shield deals damage as if it were a weapon of two size categories 
larger (a Medium light shield thus deals 1d6 points of damage and a Medium heavy 
shield deals 1d8 points of damage). The shield acts as a +1 weapon when used to 
bash. (Only light and heavy shields can have this ability.)

Moderate transmutation\textit{; }CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{bull's 
strength; }Price +1 bonus.

\textbf{Blinding:} A shield with this ability flashes with a brilliant light up 
to twice per day upon command of the wielder. Anyone within 20 feet except the 
wielder must make a DC 14 Reflex save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds.

Moderate evocation\textit{; }CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{searing 
light; }Price +1 bonus.

\textbf{Cold Resistance:} A suit of armor or a shield with this property normally 
has a bluish, icy hue or is adorned with furs and shaggy pelts. The armor absorbs 
the first 10 points of cold damage per attack that the wearer would normally take 
(similar to the \textit{resist energy }spell).

Faint abjuration; CL 3rd; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{resist energy; }Price 
+18,000 gp.

\textbf{Cold Resistance, Improved:} As cold resistance, except it absorbs the first 
20 points of cold damage per attack.

Moderate abjuration; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{resist energy; 
}Price +42,000 gp.

\textbf{Cold Resistance, Greater:} As cold resistance, except it absorbs the first 
30 points of cold damage per attack.

Moderate abjuration; CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{resist energy; 
}Price +66,000 gp.

\textbf{Electricity Resistance:} A suit of armor or a shield with this property 
normally has a bluish hue and often bears a storm or lightning motif. The armor 
absorbs the first 10 points of electricity damage per attack that the wearer would 
normally take (similar to the \textit{resist energy }spell).

Faint abjuration; CL 3rd; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{resist energy; }Price 
+18,000 gp.

\textbf{Electricity Resistance, Improved: }As electricity resistance, except it 
absorbs the first 20 points of electricity damage per attack.

Moderate abjuration; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{resist energy; 
}Price +42,000 gp.

\textbf{Electricity Resistance, Greater: }As electricity resistance, except it 
absorbs the first 30 points of electricity damage per attack.

Moderate abjuration; CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{resist energy; 
}Price +66,000 gp.

\textbf{Etherealness:} On command, this ability allows the wearer of the armor 
to become ethereal (as the \textit{ethereal jaunt }spell) once per day. The character 
can remain ethereal for as long as desired, but once he returns to normal, he cannot 
become ethereal again that day.

Strong transmutation\textit{; }CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{ethereal 
jaunt; }Price +49,000 gp.

\textbf{Fire Resistance:} A suit of armor with this ability normally has a reddish 
hue and often is decorated with a draconic motif. The armor absorbs the first 10 
points of fire damage per attack that the wearer would normally take (similar to 
the \textit{resist energy }spell).

Faint abjuration; CL 3rd; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{resist energy; }Price 
+18,000 gp.

\textbf{Fire Resistance, Improved: }As fire resistance, except it absorbs the first 
20 points of fire damage per attack.

Moderate abjuration; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{resist energy; 
}Price +42,000 gp.

\textbf{Fire Resistance, Greater:} As fire resistance, except it absorbs the first 
30 points of fire damage per attack.

Moderate abjuration; CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{resist energy; 
}Price +66,000 gp.

\textbf{Fortification: }This suit of armor or shield produces a magical force that 
protects vital areas of the wearer more effectively. When a critical hit or sneak 
attack is scored on the wearer, there is a chance that the critical hit or sneak 
attack is negated and damage is instead rolled normally.

Strong abjuration\textit{; }CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{limited 
wish }or \textit{miracle; }Price varies (see above).

\textbf{Ghost Touch:} This armor or shield seems almost translucent. Both its enhancement 
bonus and its armor bonus count against the attacks of incorporeal creatures. It 
can be picked up, moved, and worn by incorporeal creatures at any time. Incorporeal 
creatures gain the armor or shield's enhancement bonus against both corporeal and 
incorporeal attacks, and they can still pass freely through solid objects.

Strong transmutation\textit{; }CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{etherealness; 
}Price +3 bonus.

\textbf{Glamered: }A suit of armor with this ability appears normal. Upon command, 
the armor changes shape and form to assume the appearance of a normal set of clothing. 
The armor retains all its properties (including weight) when glamered. Only a \textit{true 
seeing }spell or similar magic reveals the true nature of the armor when disguised.

Moderate illusion\textit{; }CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{disguise 
self; }Price +2,700 gp.

\textbf{Invulnerability:} This suit of armor grants the wearer damage reduction 
of 5/magic.

exactly like the \textit{spell turning }spell\textit{.}

Strong abjuration\textit{; }CL 14th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{spell 
turning; }Price +5 bonus.

\textbf{Shadow:} This armor is jet black and blurs the wearer whenever she tries 
to hide, granting a +5 competence bonus on Hide checks. (The armor's armor check 
penalty still applies normally.)

Faint illusion\textit{; }CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{invisibility;

it not only makes little sound, but it dampens sound around it. It provides a +5 
competence bonus on its wearer's Move Silently checks. (The armor's armor check 
penalty still applies normally.)

\textbf{Sonic Resistance: }A suit of armor or a shield with this property normally 
has a glistening appearance. The armor absorbs the first 10 points of sonic damage 
per attack that the wearer would normally take (similar to the \textit{resist energy 
}spell).

}Price +66,000 gp.

\textbf{Spell Resistance: }This property grants the armor's wearer spell resistance 
while the armor is worn. The spell resistance can be 13, 15, 17, or 19, depending 
on the armor.

Strong abjuration\textit{; }CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{spell 
resistance; }Price +2 bonus (SR 13), +3 bonus (SR 15), +4 bonus (SR 17), or +5 
bonus (SR 19).

\textbf{Undead Controlling:} The wearer of a suit of armor or a shield with this 
property may control up to 26 HD of undead per day, as the \textit{control undead 
}spell. At dawn each day, the wearer loses control of any undead still under his 
sway. Armor or a shield with this ability appears to be made of bone; this feature 
is entirely decorative and has no other effect on the armor.

Strong necromancy; CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{control undead}; 
Price +49,000 gp.

\textbf{Wild:} The wearer of a suit of armor or a shield with this ability preserves 
his armor bonus (and any enhancement bonus) while in a wild shape. Armor and shields 
with this ability usually appear to be made covered in leaf patterns. While the 
wearer is in a wild shape, the armor cannot be seen.

Moderate transmutation; CL 9th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{baleful polymorph}; 
Price +3 bonus.

Specific Armors

The following specific suits of armor usually are preconstructed with exactly the 
qualities described here.

\textbf{Adamantine Breastplate:} This nonmagical breastplate is made of adamantine, 
giving its wearer damage reduction of 2/-.

No aura (nonmagical); Price 10,200 gp.

\textbf{Banded Mail of Luck:} Ten 100-gp gems adorn this \textit{+3 banded mail. 
}Once per week, the armor allows its wearer to require that an attack roll made 
against him be rerolled. He must take whatever consequences come from the second 
roll. The wearer's player must decide whether to have the attack roll rerolled 
before damage is rolled.

Strong enchantment\textit{; }CL 12th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{bless; 
}Price 18,900 gp; Cost 10,150 gp + 700 XP.

\textbf{Breastplate of Command: }This finely crafted \textit{+2 breastplate }radiates 
a powerful aura of magic. When worn, the armor bestows a dignified and commanding 
aura upon its owner. The wearer gains a +2 competence bonus on all Charisma checks, 
including turning checks and Charisma-based skill checks. The wearer also gains 
a +2 competence bonus to his Leadership score. Friendly troops within 360 feet 
of the user become braver than normal. Since the effect arises in great part from 
the distinctiveness of the armor, the wearer cannot hide or conceal herself in 
any way and still have the effect function.

Strong enchantment\textit{; }CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{mass 
charm monster; }Price 25,400 gp; Cost 10,975 gp + 850 XP.

\textbf{Celestial Armor:} This bright silver or gold \textit{+3 chainmail }is so 
fine and light that it can be worn under normal clothing without betraying its 
presence. It has a maximum Dexterity bonus of +8, an armor check penalty of -2, 
and an arcane spell failure chance of 15\%. It is considered light armor, weighs 
20 pounds, and it allows the wearer to use \textit{fly }on command (as the spell) 
once per day.

Faint transmutation [good]; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, creator must be 
good, \textit{fly; }Price 22,400 gp; Cost 12,550 gp + 1,004 XP.

\textbf{Demon Armor: }This plate armor is fashioned to make the wearer appear to 
be a demon. The helmet is shaped to look like a horned demon head, and its wearer 
looks out of the open, tooth-filled mouth. This \textit{+4 full plate }allows the 
wearer to make claw attacks that deal 1d10 points of damage, strike as +1 weapons, 
and afflict the target as if she had been struck by a \textit{contagion }spell 
(Fortitude DC 14 negates). Use of \textit{contagion }requires a normal melee attack 
with the claws. The ``claws'' are built into the armor's vambraces and gauntlets. 

The armor bestows one negative level on any nonevil creature wearing it. This negative 
level persists as long as the armor is worn and disappears when the armor is removed. 
The negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome 
in any way (including \textit{restoration }spells) while the armor is worn.

Strong necromancy [evil]; CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{contagion; 
}Price 52,260 gp; Cost 26,130 gp + 2,090 XP.

\textbf{Dragonhide Plate:} This suit of full plate is made of dragonhide, rather 
than metal, so druids can wear it. It is otherwise identical to masterwork full 
plate.

No aura (nonmagical); Price 3,300 gp.

\textbf{Dwarven Plate:} This full plate is made of adamantine, giving its wearer 
damage reduction of 3/-.

No aura (nonmagical); Price 16,500 gp.

\textbf{Elven Chain:} This extremely light chainmail is made of very fine mithral 
links. Speed while wearing elven chain is 30 feet for Medium creatures, or 20 feet 
for Small. The armor has an arcane spell failure chance of 20\%, a maximum Dexterity 
bonus of +4, and an armor check penalty of -2. It is considered light armor and 
weighs 20 pounds.

No aura (nonmagical); Price 4,150 gp.

\textbf{Mithral Full Plate of Speed:} As a free action, the wearer of this fine 
set of \textit{+1 mithral full plate }can activate it, enabling her to act as though 
affected by a \textit{haste }spell for up to 10 rounds each day. The duration of 
the \textit{haste }effect need not be consecutive rounds.

Speed while wearing a suit of mithral full plate is 20 feet for Medium creatures, 
or 15 feet for Small. The armor has an arcane spell failure chance of 25\%, a maximum 
Dexterity bonus of +3, and an armor check penalty of -3. It is considered medium 
armor and weighs 25 pounds.

Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{haste}; Price 
26,500 gp.

\textbf{Mithral Shirt:} This extremely light chain shirt is made of very fine mithral 
links. Speed while wearing a mithral shirt is 30 feet for Medium creatures, or 
20 feet for Small. The armor has an arcane spell failure chance of 10\%, a maximum 
Dexterity bonus of +6, and no armor check penalty. It is considered light armor 
and weighs 10 pounds.

No aura (nonmagical); Price 1,100 gp.

\textbf{Plate Armor of the Deep: }This \textit{+1 full plate }is decorated with 
a wave and fish motif. The wearer of \textit{plate armor of the deep }is treated 
as unarmored for purposes of Swim checks. The wearer can breathe underwater and 
can converse with any creature with a language that breathes water.

Moderate abjuration\textit{; }CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{freedom 
of movement, water breathing, tongues; }Price 24,650 gp; Cost 17,150 gp + 600 XP.

\textbf{Rhino Hide:} This \textit{+2 hide }armor is made from rhinoceros hide. 
In addition to granting a +2 enhancement bonus to AC, it has a -1 armor check penalty 
and deals an additional 2d6 points of damage on any successful charge attack made 
by the wearer, including a mounted charge.

Moderate transmutation\textit{; }CL 9th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{bull's 
strength; }Price 5,165 gp; Cost 2,665 gp + 200 XP.

Specific Shields

The following specific shields usually are preconstructed with exactly the qualities 
described here.

\textbf{Absorbing Shield:} This \textit{+1 heavy steel shield }is flat black and 
seems to absorb light. Once every two days, on command, it can \textit{disintegrate 
}an object that it touches, as the spell but requiring a melee touch attack.

Strong transmutation\textit{; }CL 17th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{disintegrate; 
}Price 50,170 gp; Cost 25,170 gp + 2,000 XP.

\textbf{Caster's Shield:} This \textit{+1 light wooden shield }has a small leather 
strip on the back on which a spellcaster can scribe a single spell as on a scroll. 
A spell so scribed has only half the base raw material cost. Experience point and 
component costs remain the same. The strip cannot accommodate spells of higher 
than 3rd level. The strip is reusable.

A random \textit{caster 's shield }has a 50\% chance of having a single medium 
scroll spell on it. The spell is divine (01-80 on d\%) or arcane (81-100).

A \textit{caster's shield }has a 5\% arcane spell failure chance.

Moderate abjuration\textit{; }CL 6th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Scribe Scroll, 
creator must be at least 6th level; Price 3,153 gp (plus the value of the scroll 
spell if one is currently scribed); Cost 1,653 gp + 120 XP.

\textbf{Darkwood Buckler: }This nonmagical light wooden shield is made out of darkwood. 
It has no enhancement bonus, but its construction material makes it lighter than 
a normal wooden shield. It weighs 2-1/2 pounds and has no armor check penalty.

No aura (nonmagical); Price 205 gp.

\textbf{Darkwood Shield:} This nonmagical heavy wooden shield is made out of darkwood. 
It has no enhancement bonus, but its construction material makes it lighter than 
a normal wooden shield.

It weighs 5 pounds and has no armor check penalty.

No aura (nonmagical); Price 257 gp.

\textbf{Lion's Shield:} This \textit{+2 heavy steel shield }is fashioned to appear 
to be a roaring lion's head. Three times per day as a free action, the lion's head 
can be commanded to attack (independently of the shield wearer), biting with the 
wielder's base attack bonus (including multiple attacks, if the wielder has them) 
and dealing 2d6 points of damage. This attack is in addition to any actions performed 
by the wielder.

Moderate conjuration\textit{; }CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{summon 
nature's ally IV; }Price 9,170 gp; Cost 4,670 gp + 360 XP.

much lighter than a standard steel shield. It has a 5\% arcane spell failure chance 
and no armor check penalty. It weighs 5 pounds.

No aura (nonmagical); Price 1,020 gp.

\textbf{Spined Shield: }This \textit{+1 heavy steel shield }is covered in spines. 
It acts as a normal spiked shield. On command up to three times per day, the shield's 
wearer can fire one of the shield's spines. A fired spine has a +1 enhancement 
bonus, a range increment of 120 feet, and deals 1d10 points of damage (19-20/x2). 
Fired spines regenerate each day.

missile; }Price 5,580 gp; Cost 2,740 gp + 223 XP.

}Price 17,257 gp; Cost 8,628 gp and 5 sp + 690 XP.

\vspace{12pt}
WEAPONS

Magic weapons have enhancement bonuses ranging from +1 to +5. They apply these 
bonuses to both attack and damage rolls when used in combat. All magic weapons 
are also masterwork weapons, but their masterwork bonus on attack rolls does not 
stack with their enhancement bonus on attack rolls.

Weapons come in two basic categories: melee and ranged. Some of the weapons listed 
as melee weapons can also be used as ranged weapons. In this case, their enhancement 
bonus applies to either type of attack.

In addition to an enhancement bonus, weapons may have special abilities. Special 
abilities count as additional bonuses for determining the market value of the item, 
but do not modify attack or damage bonuses (except where specifically noted). A 
single weapon cannot have a modified bonus (enhancement bonus plus special ability 
bonus equivalents) higher than +10. A weapon with a special ability must have at 
least a +1 enhancement bonus.

A weapon or a kind of ammunition may be made of an unusual material. Roll d\%: 
01-95 indicates that the item is of a standard sort, and 96-100 indicates that 
it is made of a special material.

\textbf{Caster Level for Weapons: }The caster level of a weapon with a special 
ability is given in the item description. For an item with only an enhancement 
bonus and no other abilities, the caster level is three times the enhancement bonus. 
If an item has both an enhancement bonus and a special ability, the higher of the 
two caster level requirements must be met.

\textbf{Additional Damage Dice:} Some magic weapons deal additional dice of damage. 
Unlike other modifiers to damage, additional dice of damage are not multiplied 
when the attacker scores a critical hit.

\textbf{Ranged Weapons and Ammunition:} The enhancement bonus from a ranged weapon 
does not stack with the enhancement bonus from ammunition. Only the higher of the 
two enhancement bonuses applies.

Ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an enhancement bonus of +1 or higher 
is treated as a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Similarly, 
ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an alignment gains the alignment 
of that projectile weapon (in addition to any alignment it may already have).

\textbf{Magic Ammunition and Breakage:} When a magic arrow, crossbow bolt, or sling 
bullet misses its target, there is a 50\% chance it breaks or otherwise is rendered 
useless. A magic arrow, bolt, or bullet that hits is destroyed.

\textbf{Light Generation:} Fully 30\% of magic weapons shed light equivalent to 
a \textit{light }spell (bright light in a 20-foot radius, shadowy light in a 40-foot 
radius). These glowing weapons are quite obviously magical. Such a weapon can't 
be concealed when drawn, nor can its light be shut off. Some of the specific weapons 
detailed below always or never glow, as defined in their descriptions.

\textbf{Hardness and Hit Points:} An attacker cannot damage a magic weapon that 
has an enhancement bonus unless his own weapon has at least as high an enhancement 
bonus as the weapon or shield struck. Each +1 of enhancement bonus also adds 1 
to the weapon's or shield's hardness and hit points.

\textbf{Activation:} Usually a character benefits from a magic weapon in the same 
way a character benefits from a mundane weapon---by attacking with it. If a weapon 
has a special ability that the user needs to activate then the user usually needs 
to utter a command word (a standard action).

\textbf{Magic Weapons and Critical Hits:} Some weapon qualities and some specific 
weapons have an extra effect on a critical hit. This special effect functions against 
creatures not subject to critical hits, such as undead, elementals, and constructs. 
When fighting against such creatures, roll for critical hits as you would against 
humanoids or any other creature subject to critical hits. On a successful critical 
roll, apply the special effect, but do not multiply the weapon's regular damage.

\textbf{Weapons for Unusually Sized Creatures:} The cost of weapons for creatures 
who are neither Small nor Medium varies\textit{. }The cost of the masterwork quality 
and any magical enhancement remains the same.

\textbf{Special Qualities:} Roll d\%. If the item is a melee weapon, a 01-30 result 
indicates that the item sheds light, 31-45 indicates that something (a design, 
inscription, or the like) provides a clue to the weapon's function, and 46-100 
indicates no special qualities. 

If the item is a ranged weapon, a 01-15 result indicates that something (a design, 
inscription, or the like) provides a clue to the weapon's function, and 16-100 
indicates no special qualities.

Magic Weapon Special Ability Descriptions

In addition to enhancement bonuses, weapons can have one or more of the special 
abilities detailed below. A weapon with a special ability must have at least a 
+1 enhancement bonus.

\textbf{Anarchic:} An anarchic weapon is chaotically aligned and infused with the 
power of chaos. It makes the weapon chaos-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding 
damage reduction. It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against all of lawful 
alignment. It bestows one negative level on any lawful creature attempting to wield 
it. The negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears 
when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative level never results in actual 
level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including \textit{restoration 
}spells) while the weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow 
the chaotic power upon their ammunition.

Moderate evocation [chaotic]\textit{; }CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{chaos 
hammer, }creator must be chaotic; Price +2 bonus.

\textbf{Axiomatic:} An axiomatic weapon is lawfully aligned and infused with the 
power of law. It makes the weapon law-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding 
damage reduction. It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against all of chaotic 
alignment. It bestows one negative level on any chaotic creature attempting to 
wield it. The negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears 
when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative level never results in actual 
level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including \textit{restoration 
}spells) while the weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow 
the lawful power upon their ammunition.

Moderate evocation [lawful]\textit{; }CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{order's 
wrath, }creator must be lawful; Price +2 bonus.

\textbf{Bane:} A bane weapon excels at attacking one type or subtype of creature. 
Against its designated foe, its effective enhancement bonus is +2 better than its 
normal enhancement bonus. It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against the foe. 
Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the bane quality upon their ammunition. 
To randomly determine a weapon's designated foe, roll on the following table.

Moderate conjuration; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{summon monster 
I}; Price +1 bonus.

\textbf{Brilliant Energy: }A brilliant energy weapon has its significant portion 
transformed into light, although this does not modify the item's weight. It always 
gives off light as a torch (20-foot radius). A brilliant energy weapon ignores 
nonliving matter. Armor and shield bonuses to AC (including any enhancement bonuses 
to that armor) do not count against it because the weapon passes through armor. 
(Dexterity, deflection, dodge, natural armor, and other such bonuses still apply.) 
A brilliant energy weapon cannot harm undead, constructs, and objects. This property 
can only be applied to melee weapons, thrown weapons, and ammunition.

Strong transmutation\textit{; }CL 16th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{gaseous 
form, continual flame; }Price +4 bonus.

\textbf{Dancing: }As a standard action, a dancing weapon can be loosed to attack 
on its own. It fights for 4 rounds using the base attack bonus of the one who loosed 
it and then drops. While dancing, it cannot make attacks of opportunity, and the 
person who activated it is not considered armed with the weapon. In all other respects, 
it is considered wielded or attended by the creature for all maneuvers and effects 
that target items. While dancing, it takes up the same space as the activating 
character and can attack adjacent foes (weapons with reach can attack opponents 
up to 10 feet away). The dancing weapon accompanies the person who activated it 
everywhere, whether she moves by physical or magical means. If the wielder who 
loosed it has an unoccupied hand, she can grasp it while it is attacking on its 
own as a free action; when so retrieved the weapon can't dance (attack on its own) 
again for 4 rounds.

Strong transmutation\textit{; }CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{animate 
objects; }Price +4 bonus.

\textbf{Defending:} A defending weapon allows the wielder to transfer some or all 
of the sword's enhancement bonus to his AC as a bonus that stacks with all others. 
As a free action, the wielder chooses how to allocate the weapon's enhancement 
bonus at the start of his turn before using the weapon, and the effect to AC lasts 
until his next turn.

Moderate abjuration\textit{; }CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{shield 
}or \textit{shield of faith; }Price +1 bonus.

\textbf{Disruption:} A weapon of disruption is the bane of all undead. Any undead 
creature struck in combat must succeed on a DC 14 Will save or be destroyed. A 
weapon of disruption must be a bludgeoning weapon. (If you roll this property randomly 
for a piercing or slashing weapon, reroll.)

Strong conjuration; CL 14th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{heal; }Price +2 
bonus.

\textbf{Distance: }This property can only be placed on a ranged weapon. A weapon 
of distance has double the range increment of other weapons of its kind.

Moderate divination; CL 6th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{clairaudience/clairvoyance; 
}Price +1 bonus.

\textbf{Flaming: }Upon command, a flaming weapon is sheathed in fire. The fire 
does not harm the wielder. The effect remains until another command is given. A 
flaming weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of fire damage on a successful hit. Bows, 
crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the fire energy upon their ammunition.

Moderate evocation\textit{; }CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor and \textit{flame 
blade, flame strike, }or \textit{fireball; }Price +1 bonus.

\textbf{Flaming Burst: }A flaming burst weapon functions as a flaming weapon that 
also explodes with flame upon striking a successful critical hit. The fire does 
not harm the wielder. In addition to the extra fire damage from the flaming ability 
(see above), a flaming burst weapon deals an extra 1d10 points of fire damage on 
a successful critical hit. If the weapon's critical multiplier is x3, add an extra 
2d10 points of fire damage instead, and if the multiplier is x4, add an extra 3d10 
points of fire damage. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the fire energy 
upon their ammunition.

Even if the flaming ability is not active, the weapon still deals its extra fire 
damage on a successful critical hit.

Strong evocation\textit{; }CL 12th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor and \textit{flame 
blade, flame strike, }or \textit{fireball; }Price +2 bonus.

\textbf{Frost:} Upon command, a frost weapon is sheathed in icy cold. The cold 
does not harm the wielder. The effect remains until another command is given. A 
frost weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of cold damage on a successful hit. Bows, 
crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the cold energy upon their ammunition.

Moderate evocation\textit{; }CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{chill 
metal }or \textit{ice storm; }Price +1 bonus.

\textbf{Ghost Touch:} A ghost touch weapon deals damage normally against incorporeal 
creatures, regardless of its bonus. (An incorporeal creature's 50\% chance to avoid 
damage does not apply to attacks with ghost touch weapons.) The weapon can be picked 
up and moved by an incorporeal creature at any time. A manifesting ghost can wield 
the weapon against corporeal foes. Essentially, a ghost touch weapon counts as 
either corporeal or incorporeal at any given time, whichever is more beneficial 
to the wielder.

Moderate conjuration; CL 9th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{plane shift; 
}Price +1 bonus.

\textbf{Holy:} A holy weapon is imbued with holy power. This power makes the weapon 
good-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damage reduction. It deals an 
extra 2d6 points of damage against all of evil alignment. It bestows one negative 
level on any evil creature attempting to wield it. The negative level remains as 
long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. 
This negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome 
in any way (including \textit{restoration }spells) while the weapon is wielded. 
Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the holy power upon their ammunition.

Moderate evocation [good]; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{holy smite, 
}creator must be good; Price +2 bonus.

\textbf{Icy Burst:} An icy burst weapon functions as a frost weapon that also explodes 
with frost upon striking a successful critical hit. The frost does not harm the 
wielder. In addition to the extra damage from the frost ability, an icy burst weapon 
deals an extra 1d10 points of cold damage on a successful critical hit. If the 
weapon's critical multiplier is x3, add an extra 2d10 points of cold damage instead, 
and if the multiplier is x4, add an extra 3d10 points. Bows, crossbows, and slings 
so crafted bestow the cold energy upon their ammunition. 

Even if the frost ability is not active, the weapon still deals its extra cold 
damage on a successful critical hit.

Moderate evocation\textit{; }CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{chill 
metal }or \textit{ice storm; }Price +2 bonus.

\textbf{Keen:} This ability doubles the threat range of a weapon. Only piercing 
or slashing weapons can be keen. (If you roll this property randomly for an inappropriate 
weapon, reroll.) This benefit doesn't stack with any other effect that expands 
the threat range of a weapon (such as the \textit{keen edge }spell or the Improved 
Critical feat).

Moderate transmutation\textit{; }CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{keen 
edge; }Price +1 bonus.

\textit{\textbf{Ki }}\textbf{Focus:} The magic weapon serves as a channel for the 
wielder's \textit{ki}, allowing her to use her special \textit{ki }attacks through 
the weapon as if they were unarmed attacks. These attacks include the monk's stunning 
attack, \textit{ki }strike, and quivering palm, as well as the Stunning Fist feat. 
Only melee weapons can have the \textit{ki }focus ability.

Moderate transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, creator must be a monk; 
Price +1 bonus.

\textbf{Merciful: }The weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of damage, and all damage 
it deals is nonlethal damage. On command, the weapon suppresses this ability until 
commanded to resume it. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the merciful 
effect upon their ammunition.

Faint conjuration; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{cure light wounds}; 
Price +1 bonus.

\textbf{Mighty Cleaving:} A mighty cleaving weapon allows a wielder with the Cleave 
feat to make one additional cleave attempt in a round.

Moderate evocation\textit{; }CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{divine 
power; }Price +1 bonus.

\textbf{Returning:} This special ability can only be placed on a weapon that can 
be thrown. A returning weapon flies through the air back to the creature that threw 
it. It returns to the thrower just before the creature's next turn (and is therefore 
ready to use again in that turn).

Catching a returning weapon when it comes back is a free action. If the character 
can't catch it, or if the character has moved since throwing it, the weapon drops 
to the ground in the square from which it was thrown.

Moderate transmutation\textit{; }CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{telekinesis; 
}Price +1 bonus.

\textbf{Seeking:} Only ranged weapons can have the seeking ability. The weapon 
veers toward its target, negating any miss chances that would otherwise apply, 
such as from concealment. (The wielder still has to aim the weapon at the right 
square. Arrows mistakenly shot into an empty space, for example, do not veer and 
hit invisible enemies, even if they are nearby.)

Strong divination; CL 12th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{true seeing}; Price 
+1 bonus.

\textbf{Shock:} Upon command, a shock weapon is sheathed in crackling electricity. 
The electricity does not harm the wielder. The effect remains until another command 
is given. A shock weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of electricity damage on a successful 
hit. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the electricity energy upon 
their ammunition.

Moderate evocation\textit{; }CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{call lightning 
}or \textit{lightning bolt; }Price +1 bonus.

\textbf{Shocking Burst:} A shocking burst weapon functions as a shock weapon that 
also explodes with electricity upon striking a successful critical hit. The electricity 
does not harm the wielder. In addition to the extra electricity damage from the 
shock ability, a shocking burst weapon deals an extra 1d10 points of electricity 
damage on a successful critical hit. If the weapon's critical multiplier is x3, 
add an extra 2d10 points of electricity damage instead, and if the multiplier is 
x4, add an extra 3d10 points. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the 
electricity energy upon their ammunition.

Even if the shock ability is not active, the weapon still deals its extra electricity 
damage on a successful critical hit.

Moderate evocation\textit{; }CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{call 
lightning }or \textit{lightning bolt; }Price +2 bonus.

\textbf{Speed: }When making a full attack action, the wielder of a speed weapon 
may make one extra attack with it. The attack uses the wielder's full base attack 
bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. (This benefit is not cumulative 
with similar effects, such as a \textit{haste }spell.)

Moderate transmutation\textit{; }CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{haste; 
}Price +3 bonus.

\textbf{Spell Storing:} A spell storing weapon allows a spellcaster to store a 
single targeted spell of up to 3rd level in the weapon. (The spell must have a 
casting time of 1 standard action.) Any time the weapon strikes a creature and 
the creature takes damage from it, the weapon can immediately cast the spell on 
that creature as a free action if the wielder desires. (This special ability is 
an exception to the general rule that casting a spell from an item takes at least 
as long as casting that spell normally.) Once the spell has been cast from the 
weapon, a spellcaster can cast any other targeted spell of up to 3rd level into 
it. The weapon magically imparts to the wielder the name of the spell currently 
stored within it. A randomly rolled spell storing weapon has a 50\% chance to have 
a spell stored in it already.

Strong evocation (plus aura of stored spell)\textit{; }CL 12th; Craft Magic Arms 
and Armor, creator must be a caster of at least 12th level; Price +1 bonus.

\textbf{Thundering:} A thundering weapon creates a cacophonous roar like thunder 
upon striking a successful critical hit. The sonic energy does not harm the wielder. 
A thundering weapon deals an extra 1d8 points of sonic damage on a successful critical 
hit. If the weapon's critical multiplier is x3, add an extra 2d8 points of sonic 
damage instead, and if the multiplier is x4, add an extra 3d8 points of sonic damage. 
Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the sonic energy upon their ammunition. 
Subjects dealt a critical hit by a thundering weapon must make a DC 14 Fortitude 
save or be deafened permanently.

Faint necromancy\textit{; }CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{blindness/deafness; 
}Price +1 bonus.

\textbf{Throwing: }This ability can only be placed on a melee weapon. A melee weapon 
crafted with this ability gains a range increment of 10 feet and can be thrown 
by a wielder proficient in its normal use.

Faint transmutation\textit{; }CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{magic 
stone; }Price +1 bonus.

\textbf{Unholy:} An unholy weapon is imbued with unholy power. This power makes 
the weapon evil-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damage reduction. It 
deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against all of good alignment. It bestows one 
negative level on any good creature attempting to wield it. The negative level 
remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer 
wielded. This negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot 
be overcome in any way (including \textit{restoration }spells) while the weapon 
is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the unholy power upon 
their ammunition.

Moderate evocation [evil]\textit{; }CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{unholy 
blight, }creator must be evil; Price +2 bonus.

\textbf{Vicious:} When a vicious weapon strikes an opponent, it creates a flash 
of disruptive energy that resonates between the opponent and the wielder. This 
energy deals an extra 2d6 points of damage to the opponent and 1d6 points of damage 
to the wielder. Only melee weapons can be vicious.

Moderate necromancy; CL 9th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{enervation}; Price 
+1 bonus.

\textbf{Vorpal:} This potent and feared ability allows the weapon to sever the 
heads of those it strikes. Upon a roll of natural 20 (followed by a successful 
roll to confirm the critical hit), the weapon severs the opponent's head (if it 
has one) from its body. Some creatures, such as many aberrations and all oozes, 
have no heads. Others, such as golems and undead creatures other than vampires, 
are not affected by the loss of their heads. Most other creatures, however, die 
when their heads are cut off. A vorpal weapon must be a slashing weapon. (If you 
roll this property randomly for an inappropriate weapon, reroll.)

Strong necromancy and transmutation\textit{; }CL 18th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor\textit{, 
circle of death}, \textit{keen edge; }Price +5 bonus.

\textbf{Wounding:} A wounding weapon deals 1 point of Constitution damage from 
blood loss when it hits a creature. A critical hit does not multiply the Constitution 
damage. Creatures immune to critical hits (such as plants and constructs) are immune 
to the Constitution damage dealt by this weapon.

Moderate evocation; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{mage's sword; 
}Price +2 bonus.

Specific Weapons

The following specific weapons usually are preconstructed with exactly the qualities 
described here.

\textbf{Adamantine Battleaxe:} This nonmagical axe is made out of adamantine. As 
a masterwork weapon, it has a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls.

No aura (nonmagical); Price 3,010 gp.

\textbf{Adamantine Dagger: }This nonmagical dagger is made out of adamantine. As 
a masterwork weapon, it has a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls.

No aura (nonmagical); Price 3,002 gp.

\textbf{Assassin's Dagger:} This wicked-looking, curved \textit{+2 dagger }provides 
a +1 bonus to the DC of a Fortitude save forced by the death attack of an assassin.

Moderate necromancy\textit{; }CL 9th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{slay 
living; }Price 18,302 gp; Cost 9,302 gp + 720 XP.

\textbf{Dagger of Venom: }This black \textit{+1 dagger }has a serrated edge. It 
allows the wielder to use a \textit{poison }effect (as the spell, save DC 14) upon 
a creature struck by the blade once per day. The wielder can decide to use the 
power after he has struck. Doing so is a free action, but the \textit{poison }effect 
must be invoked in the same round that the dagger strikes.

Faint necromancy\textit{; }CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{poison; 
}Price 8,302 gp; Cost 4,302 gp + 320 XP.

\textbf{Dwarven Thrower: }This weapon commonly functions as a \textit{+2 warhammer. 
}In the hands of a dwarf, the warhammer gains an additional +1 enhancement bonus 
(for a total enhancement bonus of +3) and gains the returning special ability. 
It can be hurled with a 30-foot range increment. When hurled, it deals an extra 
2d8 points of damage against giants or an extra 1d8 points of damage against any 
other target.

Moderate evocation\textit{; }CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, creator must 
be a dwarf of at least 10th level; Price 60,312 gp; Cost 30,312 gp + 2,400 XP.

\textbf{Flame Tongue:} This is a \textit{+1 flaming burst longsword. }Once per 
day, the sword can blast forth a fiery ray at any target within 30 feet as a ranged 
touch attack. The ray deals 4d6 points of fire damage on a successful hit.

Moderate evocation; CL 12th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{scorching ray, 
}and \textit{flame blade, flame strike, }or \textit{fireball; }Price 20,715 gp; 
Cost 10,515 gp + 816 XP.

\textbf{Frost Brand:} This \textit{+3 frost greatsword }sheds light as a torch 
when the temperature drops below 0°F. At such times it cannot be concealed when 
drawn, nor can its light be shut off. Its wielder is protected from fire; the sword 
absorbs the first 10 points of fire damage each round that the wielder would otherwise 
take\textit{.}

A \textit{frost brand }extinguishes all nonmagical fires in its area. As a standard 
action, it can also dispel lasting fire spells\textit{, }but not instantaneous 
effects\textit{, }though you must succeed on a dispel check (1d20 +14) against 
each spell to dispel it. The DC to dispel such spells is 11 + the caster level 
of the fire spell.

Strong evocation\textit{; }CL 14th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{ice storm, 
dispel magic, protection from energy; }Price 54,475 gp; Cost 27,375 gp and 5 sp 
+ 2179 XP.

\textbf{Holy Avenger: }This \textit{+2 cold iron longsword }becomes a \textit{+5 
holy cold iron longsword }in the hands of a paladin.

It provides spell resistance of 5 + the paladin's level to the wielder and anyone 
adjacent to her. It also enables the wielder to use \textit{greater dispel magic 
}(once per round as a standard action) at the class level of the paladin. (Only 
the area dispel is possible, not the targeted dispel or counterspell versions of 
\textit{greater dispel magic.})

Strong abjuration\textit{; }CL 18th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{holy aura, 
}creator must be good; Price 120,630 gp; Cost 60,630 gp + 4,800 XP.

\textbf{Javelin of Lightning: }This javelin becomes a 5d6 \textit{lightning bolt 
}when thrown (Reflex DC 14 half ). It is consumed in the attack.

Faint evocation\textit{; }CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{lightning 
bolt; }Price 1,500 gp; Cost 750 gp + 30 XP.

\textbf{Life-Drinker:} This \textit{+1 greataxe }is favored by undead and constructs, 
who do not suffer its drawback. A \textit{life-drinker }bestows two negative levels 
on its target whenever it deals damage, just as if its target had been struck by 
an undead creature. One day after being struck, subjects must make a DC 16 Fortitude 
save for each negative level or lose a character level.

Each time a \textit{life-drinker }deals damage to a foe, it also bestows one negative 
level on the wielder. Any negative level gained by the wielder in this fashion 
lasts for 1 hour.

Strong necromancy\textit{; }CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{enervation; 
}Price 40,320 gp; Cost 20,320 gp + 1,600 XP.

\textbf{Luck Blade: }This \textit{+2 short sword }gives its possessor a +1 luck 
bonus on all saving throws. Its possessor also gains the power of good fortune, 
usable once per day. This extraordinary ability allows its possessor to reroll 
one roll that she just made. She must take the result of the reroll, even if it's 
worse than the original roll. In addition, a \textit{luck blade }may contain up 
to three \textit{wishes }(when randomly rolled, a \textit{luck blade }holds 1d4-1 
\textit{wishes, }minimum 0). When the last \textit{wish }is used, the sword remains 
a \textit{+2 short sword, }still grants the +1 luck bonus, and still grants its 
reroll power.

Strong evocation; CL 17th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{wish }or \textit{miracle; 
}Price 22,060 gp (0 \textit{wishes}), 62,360 gp (1 \textit{wish}), 102,660 gp (2 
\textit{wishes}), 142,960 gp (3 \textit{wishes}); Cost 11,030 gp + 882 XP (0 \textit{wishes}), 
31,180 gp + 2,494 XP (1 \textit{wish}); 51,330 gp + 4,106 XP (2 \textit{wishes}), 
71,480 gp + 5,718 XP (3 \textit{wishes}).

\textbf{Mace of Smiting: }This \textit{+3 adamantine heavy mace }has a +5 enhancement 
bonus against constructs, and any critical hit dealt to a construct completely 
destroys it (no saving throw). A critical hit dealt to an outsider deals x4 damage 
rather than x2.

Moderate transmutation\textit{; }CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{disintegrate; 
}Price 75,312 gp; Cost 39,312 gp + 2,880 XP.

\textbf{Mace of Terror:} On command, this \textit{+2 heavy mace }causes the wielder's 
clothes and appearance to transform into an illusion of darkest horror such that 
living creatures in a 30-foot cone become panicked as if by a \textit{fear }spell 
(Will DC 16 partial). They take a -2 morale penalty on saving throws, and they 
flee from the wielder. The wielder may use this ability up to three times per day. 

Strong necromancy; CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{fear; }Price 38,552 
gp; Cost 19,276 gp + 1,542 XP.

\textbf{Masterwork Cold Iron Longsword:} This nonmagical longsword is crafted out 
of cold iron. As a masterwork weapon, it has a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls.

No aura (nonmagical); Price 330 gp.

\textbf{Nine Lives Stealer:} This longsword always performs as a \textit{+2 longsword, 
}but it also has the power to draw the life force from an opponent. It can do this 
nine times before the ability is lost. At that point, the sword becomes a simple 
\textit{+2 longsword }(with a hint of evil about it). A critical hit must be dealt 
for the sword's death-dealing ability to function, and this weapon has no effect 
on creatures not subject to critical hits. The victim is entitled to a DC 20 Fortitude 
save to avoid death. If the save is successful, the sword's death-dealing ability 
does not function, no use of the ability is expended, and normal critical damage 
is determined. This sword is evil, and any good character attempting to wield it 
gains two negative levels. These negative levels remain as long as the sword is 
in hand and disappear when the sword is no longer wielded. These negative levels 
never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including 
\textit{restoration }spells) while the sword is wielded.

Strong necromancy [evil]\textit{; }CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{finger 
of death; }Price 23,057 gp; Cost 11,528 gp 5 sp + 922 XP.

\textbf{Oathbow:} Of elven make, this white \textit{+2 composite longbow }(+2 Str 
bonus) whispers ``Swift defeat to my enemies'' in Elven when nocked and pulled. 
Once per day, if the firer swears aloud to slay her target (a free action), the 
bow's whisper becomes the low shout ``Swift death to those who have wronged me.'' 
Against such a sworn enemy, the bow has a +5 enhancement bonus, and arrows launched 
from it deal an additional 2d6 points of damage (and x4 on a critical hit instead 
of the normal x3). However, the bow is treated as only a masterwork weapon against 
all foes other than the sworn enemy, and the wielder takes a -1 penalty on attack 
rolls with any weapon other than the \textit{oathbow. }These bonuses and penalties 
last for seven days or until the sworn enemy is slain or destroyed by the wielder 
of the \textit{oathbow, }whichever comes first.

The \textit{oathbow }may only have one sworn enemy at a time. Once the wielder 
swears to slay a target, he cannot make a new oath until he has slain that target 
or seven days have passed. Even if the wielder slays the sworn enemy on the same 
day that he makes the oath, he cannot activate the \textit{oathbow'}s special power 
again until 24 hours have passed from the time he made the oath.

Strong evocation; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, creator must be an elf; 
Price 25,600 gp; Cost 13,100 gp + 1,000 XP.

\textbf{Rapier of Puncturing: }Three times per day, this \textit{+2 wounding rapier 
}allows the wielder to make a touch attack with the weapon that deals 1d6 points 
of Constitution damage by draining blood. Creatures immune to critical hits are 
immune to the Constitution damage dealt by this weapon.

Strong necromancy; CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{harm; }Price 50,320 
gp; Cost 25,320 gp + 2,000 XP.

\textbf{Screaming Bolt:} One of these \textit{+2 bolts }screams when fired, forcing 
all enemies of the wielder within 20 feet of the path of the bolt to succeed on 
a DC 14 Will save or become shaken. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.

Faint enchantment; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{doom; }Price 267gp; 
Cost 128 gp and 5 sp + 10 XP.

\textbf{Shatterspike:} Wielders without the Improved Sunder feat use \textit{Shatterspike 
}as a \textit{+1 longsword }only; wielders with the Improved Sunder feat add a 
+4 bonus (including the sword's +1 enhancement bonus) to the opposed roll when 
attempting to strike a foe's weapon. If successful, \textit{Shatterspike }deals 
1d8+4 points of damage plus the wielder's Strength modifier to the target weapon 
(the target weapon's hardness must still be overcome with each hit). \textit{Shatterspike 
}can damage weapons with an enhancement bonus of +4 or lower.

Strong evocation; CL 13th; Str 13, Craft Arms and Armor, Power Attack, Improved 
Sunder, \textit{shatter}; Price 4,315 gp; Cost 2,315 gp + 160 XP; Weight 4 lb.

\textbf{Shifter's Sorrow:} This \textit{+1/+1 two-bladed sword }has blades of alchemical 
silver. The weapon deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against any creature with 
the shapechanger subtype. When a shapechanger or a creature in an alternate form 
(such as a druid using wild shape) is struck by the weapon, it must make a DC 15 
Will save or return to its natural form.

Strong transmutation; CL 15th; Craft Arms and Armor, \textit{baleful polymorph; 
}Price 12,780 gp; Cost 6,780 gp + 480 XP; Weight 10 lb.

\textbf{Silver Dagger, Masterwork:} This masterwork alchemical silver dagger is 
nonmagical. As a masterwork weapon, it has a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls.

No aura (nonmagical); Price 322 gp.

\textbf{Slaying Arrow:} This \textit{+1 arrow }is keyed to a particular type or 
subtype of creature. If it strikes such a creature, the target must make a DC 20 
Fortitude save or die (or, in the case of unliving targets, be destroyed) instantly. 
Note that even creatures normally exempt from Fortitude saves (undead and constructs) 
are subject to this attack. When keyed to a living creature, this is a death effect 
(and thus \textit{death ward }protects a target). To determine the type or subtype 
of creature the arrow is keyed to, roll on the table below.

A \textit{greater slaying arrow }functions just like a normal \textit{slaying arrow, 
}but the DC to avoid the death effect is 23.

Strong necromancy\textit{; }CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{finger 
of death }(\textit{slaying arrow}) or heightened \textit{finger of death }(\textit{greater

\textbf{Sleep Arrow:} This \textit{+1 arrow }is painted white and has white fletching. 
If it strikes a foe so that it would normally deal damage, it instead bursts into 
magical energy that deals nonlethal damage (in the same amount as would be lethal 
damage) and forces the target to make a DC 11 Will save or fall asleep.

Faint enchantment\textit{; }CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{sleep; 
}Price 132 gp; Cost 69 gp 5 sp + 5 XP.

\textbf{Sun Blade:} This sword is the size of a bastard sword. However, a \textit{sun 
blade }is wielded as if it were a short sword with respect to weight and ease of 
use. (In other words, the weapon appears to all viewers to be a bastard sword, 
and deals bastard sword damage, but the wielder feels and reacts as if the weapon 
were a short sword.) Any individual able to use either a bastard sword or a short 
sword with proficiency is proficient in the use of a \textit{sun blade. }Likewise, 
Weapon Focus and Weapon Specialization in short sword and bastard sword apply equally, 
but the benefits of those feats do not stack.

In normal combat, the glowing golden blade of the weapon is equal to a \textit{+2 
bastard sword. }Against evil creatures, its enhancement bonus is +4. Against Negative 
Energy Plane creatures or undead creatures, the sword deals double damage (and 
x3 on a critical hit instead of the usual x2).

The blade also has a special \textit{sunlight }power. Once per day, the wielder 
can swing the blade vigorously above her head while speaking a command word. The 
\textit{sunblade }then sheds a bright yellow radiance that is like full daylight. 
The radiance begins shining in a 10-foot radius around the sword wielder and extends 
outward at 5 feet per round for 10 rounds thereafter, to create a globe of light 
with a 60-foot radius. When the wielder stops swinging, the radiance fades to a 
dim glow that persists for another minute before disappearing entirely. All \textit{sun 
blades }are of good alignment, and any evil creature attempting to wield one gains 
one negative level. The negative level remains as long as the sword is in hand 
and disappears when the sword is no longer wielded. This negative level never results 
in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including \textit{restoration 
}spells) while the sword is wielded.

Moderate evocation\textit{; }CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{daylight, 
}creator must be good; Price 50,335 gp; Cost 25,335 gp + 2,000 XP.

\textbf{Sword of Life Stealing: }This black iron \textit{+2 longsword }bestows 
a negative level when it deals a critical hit. The sword wielder gains 1d6 temporary 
hit points each time a negative level is bestowed on another. These temporary hit 
points last for 24 hours. One day after being struck, subjects must make a DC 16 
Fortitude save for each negative level or lose a character level.

Strong necromancy\textit{; }CL 17th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{enervation; 
}Price 25,715 gp; Cost 12,857 gp and 5 sp + 1,029 XP.

\textbf{Sword of the Planes: }This longsword has an enhancement bonus of +1 on 
the Material Plane, but on any Elemental Plane its enhancement bonus increases 
to +2. (The +2 enhancement bonus also applies on the Material Plane when the weapon 
is used against elementals.) It operates as a \textit{+3 longsword }on the Astral 
Plane or the Ethereal Plane or when used against opponents native to either of 
those planes. On any other plane, or against any outsider, it functions as a \textit{+4 
longsword.}

Strong evocation\textit{; }CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{plane shift; 
}Price 22,315 gp; Cost 11,157 gp and 5 sp + 893 XP.

\textbf{Sword of Subtlety:} A \textit{+1 short sword }with a thin, dull gray blade, 
this weapon provides a +4 bonus on its wielder's attack and damage rolls when he 
is making a sneak attack with it.

Moderate illusion\textit{; }CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{blur; }Price 
22,310 gp; Cost 11,155 gp + 892 XP.

\textbf{Sylvan Scimitar:} This \textit{+3 scimitar, }when used outdoors in a temperate 
climate, grants its wielder the use of the Cleave feat and deals an extra 1d6 points 
of damage.

Moderate evocation\textit{; }CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{divine 
power }or creator must be a 7th-level druid; Price 47,315gp; Cost 23,657 gp and 
5 sp + 1,893 XP.

\textbf{Trident of Fish Command:} The magical properties of this \textit{+1 trident 
}with a 6-foot-long haft enable its wielder to \textit{charm }up to 14 HD of aquatic 
animals (Will DC 16 negates, animals get a +5 bonus if currently under attack by 
the wielder or his allies), no two of which can be more than 30 feet apart. The 
wielder can use this effect up to three times per day. The wielder can communicate 
with the animals as if using a \textit{speak with animals }spell. Animals making 
their saving throw are free of control, but they will not approach within 10 feet 
of the trident. The trident can be used up to three times per day.

Moderate enchantment\textit{; }CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{speak 
with animals; }Price 18,650 gp; Cost 9,325 gp + 746 XP.

\textbf{Trident of Warning:} A weapon of this type enables its wielder to determine 
the location, depth, kind, and number of aquatic predators within 680 feet. A \textit{trident 
of warning }must be grasped and pointed in order for the character using it to 
gain such information, and it requires 1 round to scan a hemisphere with a radius 
of 680 feet. The weapon is otherwise a \textit{+2 trident.}

Moderate divination\textit{; }CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{locate 
creature; }Price 10,115 gp; Cost 5,057 gp and 5 sp + 405 XP.
