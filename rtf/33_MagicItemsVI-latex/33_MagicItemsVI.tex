{\LARGE{}MAGIC ITEMS VI (INTELLIGENT, CURSED, \& ARTIFACTS)}

\vspace{12pt}
{\LARGE{}INTELLIGENT ITEMS}

Magic items sometimes have intelligence of their own. Magically imbued with sentience, 
these items think and feel the same way characters do and should be treated as 
NPCs. Intelligent items have extra abilities and sometimes extraordinary powers 
and special purposes. Only permanent magic items (as opposed to single-use items 
or those with charges) can be intelligent. (This means that potions, scrolls, and 
wands, among other items, are never intelligent.) In general, less than 1\% of 
magic items have intelligence.

Intelligent items can actually be considered creatures because they have Intelligence, 
Wisdom, and Charisma scores. Treat them as constructs. Intelligent items often 
have the ability to illuminate their surroundings at will (as magic weapons do); 
many cannot see otherwise.

Unlike most magic items, intelligent items can activate their own powers without 
waiting for a command word from their owner. Intelligent items act during their 
owner's turn in the initiative order.

\vspace{12pt}
INTELLIGENT ITEM ALIGNMENT

Any item with intelligence has an alignment. Note that intelligent weapons already 
have alignments, either stated or by implication.  If you're generating a random 
intelligent weapon, that weapon's alignment must fit with any alignment-oriented 
special abilities it has.

Any character whose alignment does not correspond to that of the item (except as 
noted by the asterisks on the table) gains one negative level if he or she so much 
as picks up the item. Although this negative level never results in actual level 
loss, it remains as long as the item is in hand and cannot be overcome in any way 
(including \textit{restoration }spells). This negative level is cumulative with 
any other penalties the item might already place on inappropriate wielders. Items 
with Ego scores (see below) of 20 to 29 bestow two negative levels. Items with 
Ego scores of 30 or higher bestow three negative levels.

\hline
\end{tabular}

\vspace{12pt}
Purpose

An item's purpose must suit the type and alignment of the item and should always 
be treated reasonably. A purpose of ``defeat/slay arcane spellcasters'' doesn't 
mean that the sword forces the wielder to kill every wizard she sees. Nor does 
it mean that the sword believes it is possible to kill every wizard, sorcerer, 
and bard in the world. It does mean that the item hates arcane spellcasters and 
wants to bring the local wizard's cabal to ruin, as well as end the rule of a sorceress-queen 
in a nearby land. Likewise, a purpose of ``defend elves'' doesn't mean that if 
the wielder is an elf, he only wants to help himself. It means that the item wants 
to be used in furthering the cause of elves, stamping out their enemies and aiding 
their leaders. A purpose of ``defeat/slay all'' isn't just a matter of self-preservation. 
It means that the item won't rest (or let its wielder rest) until it places itself 
above all others.

\vspace{12pt}
DEDICATED POWER

A dedicated power operates only when an intelligent item is in pursuit of its special 
purpose. This determination is always made by the item. It should always be easy 
and straightforward to see how the ends justify the means. Unlike its other powers, 
an intelligent item can refuse to use its dedicated power even if the owner is 
dominant (see Items against Characters, below).

\vspace{12pt}
ITEM EGO

Ego is a measure of the total power and force of personality that an item possesses. 
Only after all aspects of an item have been generated can its Ego score be calculated. 
An item's Ego score helps determine whether the item or the character is dominant 
in their relationship, as detailed below.

\vspace{12pt}
ITEMS AGAINST CHARACTERS

When an item has an Ego of its own, it has a will of its own. The item is, of course, 
absolutely true to its alignment. If the character who possesses the item is not 
true to that alignment's goals or the item's special purpose, personality conflict---item 
against character---results. Similarly, any item with an Ego score of 20 or higher 
always considers itself superior to any character, and a personality conflict results 
if the possessor does not always agree with the item.

When a personality conflict occurs, the possessor must make a Will saving throw 
(DC = item's Ego). If the possessor succeeds, she is dominant. If she fails, the 
item is dominant. Dominance lasts for one day or until a critical situation occurs 
(such as a major battle, a serious threat to either the item or the character, 
and so on). Should an item gain dominance, it resists the character's desires and 
demands concessions such as any of the following.• 

\parindent=3pt
Removal of associates or items whose alignment or personality is distasteful to 
the item.• 

The character divesting herself of all other magic items or items of a certain 
type.• 

\parindent=7pt
Obedience from the character so the item can direct where they go for its own purposes.• 

\parindent=3pt
Immediate seeking out and slaying of creatures hateful to the item.• 

Magical protections and devices to protect the item from molestation when it is 
not in use.• 

\parindent=7pt
That the character carry the item with her on all occasions.• 

\parindent=3pt
That the character relinquish the item in favor of a more suitable possessor due 
to alignment differences or conduct.

\parindent=0pt
In extreme circumstances, the item can resort to even harsher measures, such as 
the following acts:• 

\parindent=3pt
Force its possessor into combat.• 

Refuse to strike opponents.• 

\parindent=7pt
Strike at its wielder or her associates.• 

\parindent=3pt
Force its possessor to surrender to an opponent.• 

Cause itself to drop from the character's grasp.

\vspace{12pt}
Naturally, such actions are unlikely when harmony reigns between the character's 
and item's alignments or when their purposes and personalities are well matched. 
Even so, an item might wish to have a lesser character possess it in order to easily 
establish and maintain dominance over him, or a higher-level possessor so as to 
better accomplish its goals.

All magic items with personalities desire to play an important role in whatever 
activity is under way, particularly combat. Such items are rivals of each other, 
even if they are of the same alignment. No intelligent item wants to share its 
wielder with others. An intelligent item is aware of the presence of any other 
intelligent item within 60 feet, and most intelligent items try their best to mislead 
or distract their host so that she ignores or destroys the rival. Of course, alignment 
might change this sort of behavior. 

Items with personalities are never totally controlled or silenced by the characters 
who possess them, even though they may never successfully control their possessors. 
They may be powerless to force their demands but remain undaunted and continue 
to air their wishes and demands.

\vspace{12pt}

{\LARGE{}CURSED ITEMS}

Cursed items are magic items with some sort of potentially negative impact. Sometimes 
they're directly bad for the user; sometimes they're just inconvenient. Occasionally 
they mix bad with good, forcing characters to make difficult choices. 

\begin{tabular}{|>{\raggedright}p{28pt}|>{\raggedright}p{121pt}|}
\hline
\multicolumn{2}{|p{150pt}|}{C\textbf{ursed Item Common Curses}}\tabularnewline

61-75 & Drawback\tabularnewline
\hline
76-90 & Completely different effect\tabularnewline
\hline
91-100 & Substitute specific cursed item\tabularnewline
\hline
\end{tabular}

\textbf{Delusion: }The user believes the item is what it appears to be, yet it 
actually has no magical power other than to deceive. The user is mentally fooled 
into thinking the item is functioning and cannot be convinced otherwise without 
the help of a \textit{remove curse }spell.

\textbf{Opposite Effect or Target:} These cursed items malfunction, so that either 
they do the opposite of what the creator intended, or they target the user instead 
of someone else. The interesting point to keep in mind here is that these items 
aren't always bad to have. Opposite-effect items include weapons that impose penalties 
on attack and damage rolls rather than bonuses. Just as a character shouldn't necessarily 
immediately know what the enhancement bonus of a noncursed magic item is, she shouldn't 
immediately know that a weapon is cursed. Once she knows, however, the item can 
be discarded unless some sort of compulsion is placed upon it that compels the 
wielder to keep and use it. In such cases, a \textit{remove curse }spell is generally 
needed to get rid of the item.

\textbf{Intermittent Functioning:} The three varieties of intermittent functioning 
items all function perfectly as described---at least some of the time. The three 
varieties are unreliable, dependent, and uncontrolled items.

\textit{Unreliable: }Each time the item is activated, there is a 5\% chance (01-05 
on d\%) that it does not function.

\textit{Dependent: }The item only functions in certain situations. To determine 
what the situation is, either select a situation or roll on the following table.

\textit{Uncontrolled: }An uncontrolled item occasionally activates at random times. 
Roll d\% every day. On a result of 01-05 the item activates at some random point 
during that day. 

\textbf{Requirement:} In a sense, a command word is a requirement. Nevertheless, 
some items have much more stringent requirements that must be met for them to be 
usable. To keep an item with this kind of curse functioning, one or more of the 
following conditions must be met.• 

\parindent=3pt
Character must eat twice as much as normal.• 

Character must sleep twice as much as normal.• 

\parindent=7pt
Character must undergo a specific quest (one time only, and then item functions 
normally thereafter).• 

\parindent=3pt
Character must sacrifice (destroy) 100 gp worth of valuables per day.• 

Character must sacrifice (destroy) 2,000 gp worth of magic items each week.• 

\parindent=7pt
Character must swear fealty to a particular noble or his family.• 

\parindent=3pt
Character must discard all other magic items.• 

Character must worship a particular deity.• 

\parindent=7pt
Character must change her name to a specific name. (The item only works for characters 
of that name.)• 

\parindent=3pt
Character must add a specific class at the next opportunity if not of that class 
already.• 

Character must have a minimum number of ranks in a particular skill.• 

\parindent=7pt
Character must sacrifice some part of her life energy (2 points of Constitution) 
one time. If the character gets the Constitution points back (such as from a \textit{restoration 
}spell), the item ceases functioning. (The item does not cease functioning if the 
character receives a Constitution increase caused by level gain, a \textit{wish, 
}or the use of a magic item.)• 

\parindent=3pt
Item must be cleansed with holy water each day.• 

Item must be used to kill a living creature each day.• 

\parindent=7pt
Item must be bathed in volcanic lava once per month.• 

\parindent=3pt
Item must be used at least once a day, or it won't function again for its current 
possessor.• 

Item must draw blood when wielded (weapons only). It can't be put away or exchanged 
for another weapon until it has scored a hit.• 

\parindent=7pt
Item must have a particular spell cast upon it each day (such as \textit{bless, 
atonement, }or \textit{animate objects}).

\parindent=0pt
Requirements are so dependent upon suitability to the item that they should never 
be determined randomly. An item with a requirement that is also intelligent often 
imposes its requirement through its personality. If the requirement is not met, 
the item ceases to function. If it is met, usually the item functions for one day 
before the requirement must be met again (although some requirements are one time 
only, others monthly, and still others continuous).

\textbf{Drawback:} Items with drawbacks are usually still beneficial to the possessor 
but they also carry some negative aspect. Although sometimes drawbacks occur only 
when the item is used (or held, in the case of some items such as weapons), usually 
the drawback remains with the character for as long as she has the item.

Roll on the table below to generate a drawback that (unless otherwise indicated) 
remains in effect as long as the item is in the character's possession.

SPECIFIC CURSED ITEMS

Specific Cursed Items are provided as examples of cursed items. They are given 
creation prerequisites, should someone want to intentionally create them (although 
that does not need to be the origin of the item). Note, however, two exceptions: 
The \textit{crystal hypnosis ball }and the \textit{bag of devouring }cannot be 
created by any known means.

A simple \textit{detect magic }spell yields a misleading aura and strength, often 
indicating that the item is a noncursed item of similar sort. An \textit{identify 
}spell only has a 1\% chance per caster level to reveal a cursed item's true properties, 
including the cursed aspect. \textit{Analyze dweomer }reveals the true nature of 
a cursed item.

\vspace{12pt}
\textbf{Amulet of Inescapable Location:} This device is typically worn on a chain 
or as a brooch. It appears, to magical analysis, to prevent location, scrying or 
detection or influence by \textit{detect thoughts }or telepathy. It seems to be 
an \textit{amulet of proof against detection and location}. Actually, the amulet 
gives the wearer a -10 penalty on all saves against divination spells.

Moderate abjuration; CL 10th; Create Wondrous Item, \textit{bestow curse; }Price 
1,000 gp.

\textbf{Armor of Arrow Attraction:} Magical analysis indicates that this armor 
is a normal suit of \textit{+3 full plate. }However, the armor is cursed. It works 
normally with regard to melee attacks but actually serves to attract ranged weapons. 
The wearer takes a -15 penalty to AC against any attack by a ranged weapon. The 
true nature of the armor does not reveal itself until the character is fired upon 
in earnest.

Strong abjuration; CL 16th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{bestow curse; }Price 
9,000 gp.

\textbf{Armor of Rage: }This armor is similar in appearance to \textit{armor of 
command }and functions as a suit of \textit{+1 full plate}. However, when it is 
worn, the armor causes the character to take a -4 penalty to Charisma. All unfriendly 
characters within 300 feet have a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls against her. 
The effect is not noticeable to the wearer or those affected. (In other words, 
the wearer does not immediately notice that donning the armor is the cause of her 
problems, nor do foes understand the reason for the depth of their enmity.)

Strong necromancy; CL 16th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{bestow curse; }Price 
1,600 gp.

\textbf{Bag of Devouring: }This bag appears to be an ordinary sack. Detection for 
magical properties makes it seem as if it were a \textit{bag of holding}. The sack 
is, however, a lure used by an extradimensional creature---in fact, one of its 
feeding orifices.

Any substance of animal or vegetable nature is subject to ``swallowing'' if thrust 
within the bag. The \textit{bag of devouring }is 90\% likely to ignore any initial 
intrusion, but any time thereafter that it senses living flesh within (such as 
if someone reaches into the bag to pull something out), it is 60\% likely to close 
around the offending member and attempt to draw the whole victim in. The bag has 
a +8 bonus on grapple checks made to pull someone in.

The bag can hold up to 30 cubic feet of matter. It acts as a \textit{bag of holding 
type I, }but each hour it has a 5\% cumulative chance of swallowing the contents 
and then spitting the stuff out in some nonspace or on some other plane. Creatures 
drawn within are consumed in 1 round. The bag destroys the victim's body and prevents 
any form of raising or resurrection that requires part of the corpse. There is 
a 50\% chance that a \textit{wish, miracle, }or \textit{true resurrection }spell 
can restore a devoured victim to life. Check once for each destroyed creature. 
If the check fails, the creature cannot be brought back to life by mortal magic.

Moderate conjuration; CL 17th; In effect, this is a creature and cannot be created; 
Price n/a.

\textbf{Boots of Dancing:} These boots initially appear and function as one of 
the other kinds of magic boots. But when the wearer is in (or fleeing from) melee 
combat, \textit{boots of dancing }impede movement, making him behave as if \textit{irresistible 
dance }had been cast upon him. Only a \textit{remove curse }spell enables the wearer 
to be rid of the boots once their true nature is revealed.

Strong enchantment; CL 16th; Create Wondrous Item, \textit{irresistible dance; 
}Price 30,000 gp.

\textbf{Bracers of Defenselessness: }These appear to be \textit{bracers of armor 
+5 }and actually serve as such until the wearer is attacked in anger by an enemy 
with a Challenge Rating equal to or greater than her level. At that moment and 
thereafter, the bracers cause a -5 penalty to AC. Once their curse is activated, 
\textit{bracers of defenselessness }can be removed only by means of a \textit{remove 
curse }spell.

Moderate conjuration; CL 16th; Create Wondrous Item, \textit{mage armor, bestow 
curse; }Price 1,200 gp.

\textbf{Broom of Animated Attack:} This item is indistinguishable in appearance 
from a normal broom. It is identical to a \textit{broom of flying }by all tests 
short of attempted use.

If a command is spoken, the broom does a loop-the-loop with its hopeful rider, 
dumping him on his head from 1d4+5 feet off the ground (no falling damage, since 
the fall is less than 10 feet). The broom then attacks the victim, swatting the 
face with the straw or twig end and beating him with the handle end.

The broom gets two attacks per round with each end (two swats with the straw and 
two with the handle, for a total of four attacks per round). It attacks with a 
+5 bonus on each attack roll. The straw end causes a victim to be blinded for 1 
round when it hits. The handle deals 1d6 points of damage when it hits. The broom 
has AC 13, 18 hit points, and hardness 4.

Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; Create Wondrous Item, \textit{fly, animate objects; 
}Price 5,200 gp.

\textbf{Cloak of Poisonousness:} This cloak is usually made of a woolen material, 
although it can be made of leather. A \textit{detect poison }spell can reveal the 
presence of poison impregnated in the cloak's fabric. The garment can be handled 
without harm, but as soon as it is actually donned the wearer is killed instantly 
unless she succeeds on a DC 28 Fortitude save.

Once donned, a \textit{cloak of poisonousness }can be removed only with a \textit{remove 
curse }spell; doing this destroys the magical property of the cloak. If a \textit{neutralize 
poison }spell is then used, it is possible to revive the victim with a \textit{raise 
dead }or \textit{resurrection }spell, but not before.

Strong abjuration; CL 15th; Create Wondrous Item, \textit{poison, }and \textit{limited 
wish }or \textit{miracle; }Price 62,000 gp.

\textbf{Crystal Hypnosis Ball:} This cursed item is indistinguishable from a normal 
\textit{crystal ball. }However, anyone attempting to use the scrying device becomes 
fascinated for 1d6 minutes, and a telepathic \textit{suggestion }is implanted in 
his mind (Will DC 19 negates).

The user of the device believes that the desired creature or scene was viewed, 
but actually he came under the influence of a powerful wizard, lich, or even some 
power or being from another plane. Each further use brings the \textit{crystal 
hypnosis ball }gazer deeper under the influence of the controller, either as a 
servant or a tool. Note that throughout this time, the user remains unaware of 
his subjugation.

Moderate divination; CL 17th; In effect, this is a minor artifact and cannot be 
created; Price n/a.

\textbf{Dust of Sneezing and Choking:} This fine dust appears to be \textit{dust 
of appearance. }If cast into the air, it causes those within a 20- foot spread 
to fall into fits of sneezing and coughing. Those failing a DC 15 Fortitude save 
take 2d6 points of Constitution damage immediately. In addition, those failing 
a second DC 15 Fortitude save 1 minute later are dealt 1d6 points of Constitution 
damage. Those who succeed on either saving throw are nonetheless disabled by choking 
(treat as stunned) for 5d4 rounds.

Faint conjuration; CL 7th; Create Wondrous Item, \textit{poison; }Price 2,400 gp.

\textbf{Flask of Curses:} This item looks like an ordinary beaker, bottle, container, 
decanter, flask, or jug. It may contain a liquid, or it may emit smoke. When the 
flask is first unstoppered, all within 30 feet must make a DC 17 Will save or be 
cursed, taking a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks until 
a \textit{remove curse }spell is cast upon them.

Moderate conjuration; CL 7th; Create Wondrous Item, \textit{bestow curse; }Price 
2,100 gp.

\textbf{Gauntlets of Fumbling:} These gauntlets may be of supple leather or heavy 
protective material suitable for use with armor. In the former instance, they appear 
to be \textit{gloves of Dexterity. }In the latter case, they appear to be \textit{gauntlets 
of ogre power. }The gauntlets perform according to every test as if they were \textit{gloves 
of Dexterity }or \textit{gauntlets of ogre power }until the wearer finds herself 
under attack or in a life-and-death situation. At that time, the curse is activated. 
The wearer becomes fumble-fingered, with a 50\% chance each round of dropping anything 
held in either hand. The gauntlets also lower Dexterity by 2 points. Once the curse 
is activated, the gloves can be removed only by means of a \textit{remove curse 
}spell, a \textit{wish, }or a \textit{miracle.}

Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Create Wondrous Item, \textit{bestow curse; }Price 
1,300 gp.

\textbf{Helm of Opposite Alignment:} This metal hat looks like a typical helmet. 
When placed upon the head, however, its curse immediately takes effect (Will DC 
15 negates). On a failed save, the alignment of the wearer is radically altered 
to an alignment as different as possible from the former alignment---good to evil, 
chaotic to lawful, neutral to some extreme commitment (LE, LG, CE, or CG). Alteration 
in alignment is mental as well as moral, and the individual changed by the magic 
thoroughly enjoys his new outlook. A character who succeeds on his save can continue 
to wear the helmet without suffering the effect of the curse, but if he takes it 
off and later puts it on again, another save is required. The curse only works 
once; that is, a character whose alignment has been changed cannot change it again 
by donning the helmet a second time.

Only a \textit{wish }or a \textit{miracle }can restore former alignment, and the 
affected individual does not make any attempt to return to the former alignment. 
(In fact, he views the prospect with horror and avoids it in any way possible.) 
If a character of a class with an alignment requirement is affected, an \textit{atonement 
}spell is needed as well if the curse is to be obliterated. When a \textit{helm 
of opposite alignment }has functioned once, it loses its magical properties.

Strong transmutation; CL 12th; Create Wondrous Item, creator must be 12th level; 
Price 4,000 gp;Weight 3 lb.

\textbf{Incense of Obsession:} These blocks of incense appear to be \textit{incense 
of meditation. }If meditation and prayer are conducted while \textit{incense of 
obsession }is burning nearby, its odor and smoke cause the user to become totally 
confident that her spell ability is superior, due to the magic incense. The user 
is determined to use her spells at every opportunity, even when not needed or when 
useless. The user remains obsessed with her abilities and spells until all have 
been used or cast, or until 24 hours have elapsed.

Moderate enchantment; CL 6th; Create Wondrous Item, \textit{bestow curse; }Price 
200 gp.

\textbf{Mace of Blood:} This \textit{+3 heavy mace }must be coated in blood every 
day, or its bonus fades away (until the mace is coated again). The character using 
this mace must make a DC 13 Will save every day it is within his possession or 
become chaotic evil.

Moderate abjuration; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, creator must be at least 
9th level and chaotic evil; Price 16,000 gp.

\textbf{Medallion of Thought Projection:} This device seems like a \textit{medallion 
of thoughts}, even down to the range at which it functions, except that the thoughts 
overheard are muffled and distorted, requiring a DC 15 Will save to sort out. However, 
while the user thinks she is picking up the thoughts of others, all she is really 
hearing are figments created by the medallion itself. These illusory thoughts always 
seem plausible and thus can seriously mislead any who rely upon them. What's worse, 
unknown to her, the cursed medallion actually broadcasts her thoughts to creatures 
in the path of the beam, thus alerting them to her presence.

Faint divination; CL 7th; Create Wondrous Item, \textit{detect thoughts, ghost 
sound; }Price 1,800 gp.

\textbf{Necklace of Strangulation:} A \textit{necklace of strangulation }appears 
to be a rare and wondrous piece of valuable jewelry and, short of the use of something 
as powerful as a \textit{miracle }or a \textit{wish}, can only be identified as 
a cursed item when placed around a character's neck. The necklace immediately constricts, 
dealing 6 points of damage per round. It cannot be removed by any means short of 
a \textit{limited wish, wish, }or \textit{miracle }and remains clasped around the 
victim's throat even after his death. Only when he has decayed to a dry skeleton 
(after approximately one month) does the necklace loosen, ready for another victim.

Strong conjuration; CL 18th; Create Wondrous Item, \textit{slay living; }Price 
60,000 gp.

\textbf{Net of Snaring: }This net provides a +3 bonus on attack rolls but can only 
be used underwater, thus making it a somewhat useful item rather than what most 
would really call a cursed item. Underwater, it can be commanded to shoot forth 
up to 30 feet to trap a creature.

Moderate evocation; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{freedom of movement; 
}Price 10,000 gp.

\textbf{Periapt of Foul Rotting:} This engraved gem appears to be of little value. 
If any character keeps the periapt in her possession for more than 24 hours, she 
contracts a terrible rotting affliction that permanently drains 1 point of Dexterity, 
Constitution, and Charisma every week. The periapt (and the affliction) can be 
removed only by application of a \textit{remove curse }spell followed by a \textit{cure 
disease }and then a \textit{heal, miracle, limited wish}, or \textit{wish }spell. 
The rotting can also be countered by crushing a \textit{periapt of health }and 
sprinkling its dust upon the afflicted character (a full-round action), whereupon 
the periapt of foul rotting likewise crumbles to dust.

Faint abjuration; CL 10th; Create Wondrous Item, \textit{contagion; }Price 17,000 
gp.

\textbf{Potion of Poison:} This potion has lost its once beneficial magical abilities 
and has become a potent poison. The imbiber must make a DC 16 Fortitude save or 
take 1d10 points of Constitution damage. A minute later he must save again (DC 
16) or take 1d10 points of Constitution damage.

Moderate conjuration; CL 12th; Craft Wondrous Item, \textit{poison; }Price 5,000 
gp.

\textbf{Robe of Powerlessness: }A \textit{robe of powerlessness }appears to be 
a magic robe of another sort. As soon as a character dons this garment, she takes 
a -10 penalty to Strength and Intelligence, forgetting spells and magic knowledge 
accordingly. The robe can be removed easily, but in order to restore mind and body, 
the character must receive a \textit{remove curse }spell followed by \textit{heal}.

Moderate transmutation; CL 13th; Create Wondrous Item, \textit{bestow curse, permanency; 
}Price 5,500 gp.

\textbf{Robe of Vermin:} The wearer notices nothing unusual when the robe is donned, 
other than that it offers great magical defense (as a \textit{cloak of protection 
+4}). However, as soon as he is in a situation requiring concentration and action 
against hostile opponents, the true nature of the garment is revealed: The wearer 
immediately suffers a multitude of bites from the insects that magically infest 
the garment. He must cease all other activities in order to scratch, shift the 
robe, and generally show signs of the extreme discomfort caused by the bites and 
movement of these pests.

The wearer takes a -5 penalty on initiative checks and a -2 penalty on all attack 
rolls, saves, and skill checks. If he tries to cast a spell, he must make a Concentration 
check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose the spell.

Moderate abjuration; CL 13th; Create Wondrous Item, \textit{summon swarm, }creator 
must be at least 13th level; Price 16,500 gp.

\textbf{Ring of Clumsiness:} This ring operates exactly like a \textit{ring of 
feather falling}. However, it also makes the wearer clumsy. She takes a -4 penalty 
to Dexterity and has a 20\% chance of spell failure when trying to cast any arcane 
spell that has a somatic component. (This chance of spell failure stacks with other 
arcane spell failure chances.)

Strong transmutation; CL 15th; Forge Ring, \textit{feather fall, bestow curse; 
}Price 500 gp.

\textbf{Scarab of Death: }This small pin appears to be any one of the various beneficial 
amulets, brooches, or scarabs. However, if it is held for more than 1 round or 
carried by a living creature for 1 minute, it changes into a horrible burrowing 
beetlelike creature. The thing tears through any leather or cloth, burrows into 
flesh, and reaches the victim's heart in 1 round, causing death. A DC 25 Reflex 
save allows the wearer to tear the scarab away before it burrows out of sight, 
but he still takes 3d6 points of damage. The beetle then returns to its scarab 
form. Placing the scarab in a container of wood, ceramic, bone, ivory, or metal 
prevents the monster from coming to life and allows for long-term storage of the 
item.

Strong abjuration; CL 19th; Create Wondrous Item, \textit{slay living; }Price 80,000 
gp.

\textbf{Spear, Cursed Backbiter:} This is a \textit{+2 shortspear, }but each time 
it is used in melee against a foe and the attack roll is a natural 1, it damages 
its wielder instead of her intended target. When the curse takes effect, the spear 
curls around to strike its wielder in the back, automatically dealing the damage 
to the wielder. The curse even functions when the spear is hurled, and in such 
a case the damage to the hurler is doubled.

Moderate evocation; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{bestow curse; 
}Price 7,500 gp.

\textbf{Stone of Weight (Loadstone):} This stone appears to be a dark, smoothly 
polished stone. It reduces the possessor's base land speed to one-half of normal. 
Once picked up, the stone cannot be disposed of by any nonmagical means---if it 
is thrown away or smashed, it reappears somewhere on his person. If a \textit{remove 
curse }spell is cast upon a \textit{loadstone, }the item may be discarded normally 
and no longer haunts the individual.

Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Create Wondrous Item, \textit{slow; }Price 1,000 gp.-

\textbf{2 Sword, Cursed:} This longsword performs well against targets in practice, 
but when used against an opponent in combat, it causes its wielder to take a -2 
penalty on attack rolls.

All damage dealt is also reduced by 2 points, but never below a minimum of 1 point 
of damage on any successful hit. After one week in a character's possession, the 
sword always forces that character to employ it rather than another weapon. The 
sword's owner automatically draws it and fights with it even when she meant to 
draw or ready some other weapon. The sword can be gotten rid of only by means of 
\textit{limited wish}, \textit{wish, }or \textit{miracle}.

Strong evocation; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{bestow curse, }and 
\textit{limited wish }or \textit{miracle; }Price 1,500 gp.

\textbf{Sword, Berserking: }This item appears to have the characteristics of a 
\textit{+2 greatsword. }However, whenever the sword is used in battle, its wielder 
goes berserk (gaining all the benefits and drawbacks of the barbarian's rage ability). 
He attacks the nearest creature and continues to fight until unconscious or dead 
or until no living thing remains within 30 feet. Although many see this sword as 
a cursed object, others see it as a boon.

Moderate evocation; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{rage, bestow curse; 
}Price 17,500 gp.

\textbf{Vacuous Grimoire: }A book of this sort looks like a normal one on some 
mildly interesting topic. Any character who opens the work and reads so much as 
a single word therein must make two DC 15 Will saves. The first is to determine 
if the reader takes 1 point of permanent Intelligence drain. The second is to find 
out if the reader takes 2 points of permanent Wisdom drain. To destroy the book, 
a character must burn it while casting \textit{remove curse}. If the grimoire is 
placed with other books, its appearance instantly alters to conform to the look 
of those other works.

Strong enchantment; CL 20th; Create Wondrous Item, \textit{feeblemind; }Price 6,000

{\LARGE{}ARTIFACTS}

Artifacts are extremely powerful. Rather than merely another form of magic equipment, 
they are the sorts of legendary relics that whole campaigns can be based on. Each 
could be the center of a whole set of adventures---a quest to recover it, a fight 
against a opponent wielding it, a mission to cause its destruction, and so on.

No table has been included to randomly generate specific artifacts, since these 
items should only enter a campaign through deliberate choice on your part.

\vspace{12pt}
MINOR ARTIFACTS

Minor artifacts are not necessarily unique items. Even so, they are magic items 
that no longer can be created, at least by common mortal means.

\vspace{12pt}
Minor Artifact Descriptions

Described below is a selection of the most well-known (not necessarily the most 
numerous) minor artifacts.

\vspace{12pt}
\textbf{Book of Infinite Spells:} This work bestows upon any character of any class 
the ability to use the spells within its pages. However, any character not already 
able to use spells gains one negative level for as long as the book is in her possession 
or while she uses its power. A \textit{book of infinite spells }contains 1d8+22 
pages. The nature of each page is determined by a dice roll: 01-50, arcane spell; 
51-100, divine spell.

Determine the exact spell by using the tables for determining major scroll spells.

Once a page is turned, it can never be flipped back---paging through a \textit{book 
of infinite spells }is a one-way trip. If the book is closed, it always opens again 
to the page it was on before the book was closed. When the last page is turned, 
the book vanishes.

Once per day the owner of the book can cast the spell to which the book is opened. 
If that spell happens to be one that is on the character's class spell list, she 
can cast it up to four times per day. The pages cannot be ripped out without destroying 
the book. Similarly, the spells cannot be cast as scroll spells, nor can they be 
copied into a spellbook---their magic is bound up permanently within the book itself.

The owner of the book need not have the book on her person in order to use its 
power. The book can be stored in a place of safety while the owner is adventuring 
and still allow its owner to cast spells by means of its power.

Each time a spell is cast, there is a chance that the energy connected with its 
use causes the page to magically turn despite all precautions. The owner knows 
this and may even benefit from the turning by gaining access to a new spell. The 
chance of a page turning depends on the spell the page contains and what sort of 
spellcaster the owner is.

\textbf{Deck of Many Things: }A \textit{deck of many things }(both beneficial and 
baneful) is usually found in a box or leather pouch. Each deck contains a number 
of cards or plaques made of ivory or vellum. Each is engraved with glyphs, characters, 
and sigils. As soon as one of these cards is drawn from the pack, its magic is 
bestowed upon the person who drew it, for better or worse.

The character with a \textit{deck of many things }who wishes to draw a card must 
announce how many cards she will draw before she begins. Cards must be drawn within 
1 hour of each other, and a character can never again draw from this deck any more 
cards than she has announced. If the character does not willingly draw her allotted 
number (or if she is somehow prevented from doing so), the cards flip out of the 
deck on their own. \textit{Exception: }If the jester is drawn, the possessor of 
the deck may elect to draw two additional cards.

Each time a card is taken from the deck, it is replaced (making it possible to 
draw the same card twice) unless the draw is the jester or the fool, in which case 
the card is discarded from the pack. A \textit{deck of many things }contains 22 
cards. To simulate the magic cards, you may want to use tarot cards, as indicated 
in the second column of the accompanying table. If no tarot deck is available, 
substitute ordinary playing cards instead, as indicated in the third column. The 
effects of each card, summarized on the table, are fully described below.

\vspace{12pt}
\textit{Balance: }The character must change to a radically different alignment. 
If the character fails to act according to the new alignment, she gains a negative 
level.

\textit{Comet: }The character must single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster 
or monsters encountered, or the benefit is lost. If successful, the character gains 
enough XP to attain the next experience level.

\textit{Donjon: }This card signifies imprisonment--- either by the \textit{imprisonment 
}spell or by some powerful being. All gear and spells are stripped from the victim 
in any case. Draw no more cards.

\textit{Euryale: }The medusalike visage of this card brings a curse that only the 
fates card or a deity can remove. The -1 penalty on all saving throws is otherwise 
permanent.

\textit{Fates: }This card enables the character to avoid even an instantaneous 
occurrence if so desired, for the fabric of reality is unraveled and respun. Note 
that it does not enable something to happen. It can only stop something from happening 
or reverse a past occurrence. The reversal is only for the character who drew the 
card; other party members may have to endure the situation.

\textit{Flames: }Hot anger, jealousy, and envy are but a few of the possible motivational 
forces for the enmity. The enmity of the outsider can't be ended until one of the 
parties has been slain. Determine the outsider randomly, and assume that it attacks 
the character (or plagues her life in some way) within 1d20 days.

\textit{Fool: }The payment of XP and the redraw are mandatory. This card is always 
discarded when drawn, unlike all others except the jester.

\textit{Gem: }This card indicates wealth. The jewelry is all gold set with gems, 
each piece worth 2,000 gp, the gems 1,000 gp value each. 

\textit{Idiot: }This card causes the drain of 1d4+1 points of Intelligence immediately. 
The additional draw is optional.

\textit{Jester: }This card is always discarded when drawn, unlike all others except 
the fool. The redraws are optional.

\textit{Key: }The magic weapon granted must be one usable by the character. It 
suddenly appears out of nowhere in the character's hand.

\textit{Knight: }The fighter appears out of nowhere and serves loyally until death. 
He or she is of the same race (or kind) and gender as the character.

\textit{Moon: }This card sometimes bears the image of a moonstone gem with the 
appropriate number of \textit{wishes }shown as gleams therein; sometimes it depicts 
a moon with its phase indicating the number of \textit{wishes }(full = four; gibbous 
= three; half = two; quarter = one). These \textit{wishes }are the same as those 
granted by the 9th-level wizard spell and must be used within a number of minutes 
equal to the number received.

\textit{Rogue: }When this card is drawn, one of the character's NPC friends (preferably 
a cohort) is totally alienated and forever after

hostile. If the character has no cohorts, the enmity of some powerful personage 
(or community, or religious order) can be substituted. The hatred is secret until 
the time is ripe for it to be revealed with devastating effect.

\textit{Ruin: }As implied by its name, when this card is drawn, all nonmagical 
possessions of the drawer are lost.

\textit{Skull: }A dread wraith appears. Treat this creature as an unturnable undead. 
The character must fight it alone---if others help, they get dread wraiths to fight 
as well. If the character is slain, she is slain forever and cannot be revived, 
even with a \textit{wish }or a \textit{miracle}.

\textit{Star: }The 2 points are added to any ability the character chooses. They 
cannot be divided among two abilities. 

\textit{Sun: }Roll for a medium wondrous item until a useful item is indicated.

\textit{Talons: }When this card is drawn, every magic item owned or possessed by 
the character is instantly and irrevocably gone.

\textit{Throne: }The character becomes a true leader in people's eyes. The castle 
gained appears in any open area she wishes (but the decision where to place it 
must be made within 1 hour).

\textit{Vizier: }This card empowers the character drawing it with the one-time 
ability to call upon a source of wisdom to solve any

single problem or answer fully any question upon her request. The query or request 
must be made within one year. Whether the information gained can be successfully 
acted upon is another question entirely.

\textit{The Void: }This black card spells instant disaster. The character's body 
continues to function, as though comatose, but her psyche is trapped in a prison 
somewhere---in an object on a far plane or planet, possibly in the possession of 
an outsider. A \textit{wish }or a \textit{miracle }does not bring the character 
back, instead merely revealing the plane of entrapment. Draw no more cards.

Strong (all schools); CL 20th.

\vspace{12pt}
\textbf{Hammer of Thunderbolts:} This \textit{+3 Large returning warhammer }deals 
4d6 points of damage on any hit. Further, if the wielder wears a \textit{belt of 
giant Strength }and \textit{gauntlets of ogre power }and he knows that the hammer 
is a \textit{hammer of thunderbolts }(not just a \textit{+3 warhammer}), the weapon 
can be used to full effect: It gains a total +5 enhancement bonus, allows all \textit{belt 
}and \textit{gauntlet }bonuses to stack (only when using this weapon), and strikes 
dead any giant upon whom it scores a hit (Fortitude DC 20 negates the death effect 
but not the damage).

When hurled, on a successful attack the hammer emits a great noise, like a clap 
of thunder, causing all creatures within 90 feet to be stunned for 1 round (Fortitude 
DC 15 negates). The hammer's range increment is 30 feet.

Strong evocation, necromancy, and transmutation; CL 20th; Weight 15 lb.

\vspace{12pt}
\textbf{Philosopher's Stone:} This rare substance appears to be an ordinary, sooty 
piece of blackish rock. If the stone is broken open (break DC 20), a cavity is 
revealed at the stone's heart. This cavity is lined with a magical type of quicksilver 
that enables any arcane spellcaster to transmute base metals (iron and lead) into 
silver and gold. A single \textit{philosopher's stone }can turn from up to 5,000 
pounds of iron into silver, or up to 1,000 pounds of lead into gold. However, the 
quicksilver becomes unstable once the stone is opened and loses its potency within 
24 hours, so all transmutations must take place within that period.

The quicksilver found in the center of the stone may also be put to another use. 
If mixed with any \textit{cure }potion while the substance is still potent, it 
creates a special \textit{oil of life }that acts as a \textit{true resurrection 
}spell for any dead body it is sprinkled upon.

Strong transmutation; CL 20th;Weight 3 lb.

\vspace{12pt}
\textbf{Sphere of Annihilation:} A \textit{sphere of annihilation }is a globe of 
absolute blackness, a ball of nothingness 2 feet in diameter. The object is actually 
a hole in the continuity of the multiverse. Any matter that comes in contact with 
a sphere is instantly sucked into the void, gone, and utterly destroyed. Only the 
direct intervention of a deity can restore an annihilated character.

A \textit{sphere of annihilation }is static, resting in some spot as if it were 
a normal hole. It can be caused to move, however, by mental effort (think of this 
as a mundane form of telekinesis, too weak to move actual objects but a force to 
which the sphere, being weightless, is sensitive). A character's ability to gain 
control of a \textit{sphere of annihilation }(or to keep controlling one) is based 
on the result of a control check against DC 30 (a move action). A control check 
is 1d20 + character level + character Int modifier. If the check succeeds, the 
character can move the sphere (perhaps to bring it into contact with an enemy) 
as a free action.

Control of a sphere can be established from as far away as 40 feet (the character 
need not approach too closely). Once control is established, it must be maintained 
by continuing to make control checks (all DC 30) each round. For as long as a character 
maintains control (does not fail a check) in subsequent rounds, he can control 
the sphere from a distance of 40 feet + 10 feet per character level. The sphere's 
speed in a round is 10 feet +5 feet for every 5 points by which the character's 
control check result in that round exceeded 30.

If a control check fails, the sphere slides 10 feet in the direction of the character 
attempting to move it.

If two or more creatures vie for control of a \textit{sphere of annihilation, }the 
rolls are opposed. If none are successful, the sphere slips toward the one who 
rolled lowest.

Should a \textit{gate }spell be cast upon a \textit{sphere of annihilation}, there 
is a 50\% chance (01-50 on d\%) that the spell destroys it, a 35\% chance (51-85) 
that the spell does nothing, and a 15\% chance (86-100) that a gap is torn in the 
spatial fabric, catapulting everything within a 180-foot radius into another plane. 
If a \textit{rod of cancellation }touches a \textit{sphere of annihilation},

they negate each other in a tremendous explosion. Everything within a 60-foot radius 
takes 2d6x10 points of damage. \textit{Dispel}

\textit{magic }and \textit{mage's disjunction }have no effect on a sphere.

See also \textit{talisman of the sphere }(below).

Strong transmutation; CL 20th.

\vspace{12pt}
\textbf{Staff of the Magi:} A long wooden staff, shod in iron and inscribed with 
sigils and runes of all types, this potent artifact contains many spell powers 
and other functions. Some of its powers use charges, while others don't. The following 
powers do not use charges:• 

\textit{Detect magic• }

\textit{Enlarge person (}Fortitude DC 15 negates)• 

\textit{Hold portal• }

\textit{Light• }

\textit{Mage armor• }

\textit{Mage hand}

The following powers drain 1 charge per usage:• 

\textit{Dispel magic• }

\textit{Fireball }(10d6 damage, Reflex DC 17 half )• 

\textit{Ice storm• }

\textit{Invisibility• }

\textit{Knock• }

\textit{Lightning bolt }(10d6 damage, Reflex DC 17 half )• 

\textit{Passwall• }

\textit{Pyrotechnics }(Will or Fortitude DC 16 negates)• 

\textit{Wall of fire• }

\textit{Web}

These powers drain 2 charges per usage:• 

\textit{Monster summoning IX• }

\textit{Plane shift }(Will DC 21 negates)• 

\textit{Telekinesis }(400 lb. maximum weight; Will DC 19 negates)

A \textit{staff of the magi }gives the wielder spell resistance 23. If this is 
willingly lowered, however, the staff can also be used to absorb arcane spell energy 
directed at its wielder, as a \textit{rod of absorption} does. Unlike the rod, 
this staff converts spell levels into charges rather than retaining them as spell 
energy usable by a spellcaster. If the staff absorbs enough spell levels to exceed 
its limit of 50 charges, it explodes as if a retributive strike had been performed 
(see below). The wielder has no idea how many spell levels are cast at her, for 
the staff does not communicate this knowledge as a \textit{rod of absorption }does. 
(Thus, absorbing spells can be risky.)

\textit{Retributive Strike: }A \textit{staff of the magi }can be broken for a retributive 
strike. Such an act must be purposeful and declared by the wielder. All charges 
in the staff are released in a 30-foot spread. All within 10 feet of the broken 
staff take hit points of damage equal to 8 times the number of charges in the staff, 
those between 11 feet and 20 feet away take points equal to 6 times the number 
of charges, and those 21 feet to 30 feet distant take 4 times the number of charges. 
A DC 17 Reflex save reduces damage by half. 

The character breaking the staff has a 50\% chance (01-50 on d\%) of traveling 
to another plane of existence, but if she does not (51-100), the explosive release 
of spell energy destroys her. Only specific items, including the \textit{staff 
of the magi }and the \textit{staff of power} are capable of a retributive strike.

Strong (all schools); CL 20th;Weight 5 lb.

\textbf{Talisman of Pure Good:} A good (LG, NG, CG) divine spellcaster who possesses 
this item can cause a flaming crack to open at the feet of an evil (LE, NE, CE) 
divine spellcaster who is up to 100 feet away. The intended victim is swallowed 
up forever and sent hurtling to the center of the earth. The wielder of the talisman 
must be good, and if he is not exceptionally pure in thought and deed the evil 
character gains a DC 19 Reflex saving throw to leap away from the crack. Obviously, 
the target must be standing on solid ground for this item to function. 

A \textit{talisman of pure good }has 6 charges. If a neutral (LN, N, CN) divine 
spellcaster touches one of these stones, he takes 6d6 points of damage. If an evil 
divine spellcaster touches one, he takes 8d6 points of damage. All other characters 
are unaffected by the device.

Strong evocation [good]; CL 18th.

\vspace{12pt}
\textbf{Talisman of the Sphere:} This small adamantine loop and handle are useless 
to those unable to cast arcane spells. Characters

who cannot cast arcane spells take 5d6 points of damage merely from picking up 
and holding a talisman of this sort. However, when held by an arcane spellcaster 
who is concentrating on control of a \textit{sphere of annihilation, }a \textit{talisman 
of the sphere }doubles the character's modifier on his control check (doubling 
both his Intelligence bonus and his character level for this purpose).

If the wielder of a talisman establishes control, he need check for maintaining 
control only every other round thereafter. If control is not established, the sphere 
moves toward him. Note that while many spells and effects of cancellation have 
no effect upon a \textit{sphere of annihilation, }the talisman's power of control 
can be suppressed or canceled.

Strong transmutation; CL 16th;Weight 1 lb.

\vspace{12pt}
\textbf{Talisman of Reluctant Wishes: }A talisman of this sort appears the same 
as a \textit{stone of controlling earth elementals. }Its powers are quite different, 
however, and dependent on the Charisma of the individual holding the talisman. 
Whenever a character touches a \textit{talisman of reluctant wishes, }he must make 
a DC 15 Charisma check. 

If he fails, the device acts as a \textit{stone of weight}. Discarding or destroying 
it results in 5d6 points of damage to the character and the disappearance of the 
talisman. 

If he succeeds, the talisman remains with the character for 5d6 hours, or until 
a \textit{wish }is made with it, whichever comes first. It then disappears.

If he rolls a natural 20, the character finds it impossible to be rid of the talisman 
for as many months as he has points of Charisma. In addition, the artifact grants 
him one \textit{wish }for every 6 points of the character's Charisma. It also grows 
warm and throbs whenever its possessor comes within 20 feet of a mechanical or 
magic trap. (If the talisman is not held, its warning heat and pulses are of no 
avail.)

Regardless of which reaction results, a \textit{talisman of reluctant wishes }disappears 
when its time period expires, leaving behind a 10,000 gp diamond in its stead.

Strong conjuration; CL 20th;Weight 1 lb.

\vspace{12pt}
\textbf{Talisman of Ultimate Evil:} An evil (LE, NE, CE) divine spellcaster who 
possesses this item can cause a flaming crack to open at the feet of a good (LG, 
NG, CG) divine spellcaster who is up to 100 feet away. The intended victim is swallowed 
up forever and sent hurtling to the center of the earth. The wielder of the talisman 
must be evil, and if she is not exceptionally foul and perverse in the sights of 
her evil deity the good character gains a DC 19 Reflex save to leap away from the 
crack. Obviously, the target must be standing on solid ground for this item to 
function. 

A \textit{talisman of ultimate evil }has 6 charges. If a neutral (LN, N, CN) divine 
spellcaster touches one of these stones, she takes 6d6 points of damage. If a good 
divine spellcaster touches one, she takes 8d6 points of damage. All other characters 
are unaffected by the device.

MAJOR ARTIFACTS

Major artifacts are unique items---only one of each such item exists. These are 
the most potent of magic items, capable of altering the balance of a campaign.

Unlike all other magic items, major artifacts are not easily destroyed. Each should 
have only a single, specific means of destruction.

\vspace{12pt}
Major Artifact Descriptions

\vspace{12pt}
\textbf{The Moaning Diamond:} The \textit{Moaning Diamond }appears to be an uncut 
diamond the size of a human fist. At all times, it gives forth a baleful moaning 
sound, as if in pain. Despite the noise, the \textit{Moaning Diamond }is not evil. 
The wielder of the stone can, three times per day, call upon it to reshape earth 
and stone as if by the spell \textit{stone shape, }affecting 5,000 cubic feet of 
material. The \textit{Moaning Diamond }can summon an elder earth elemental with 
maximum hit points that serves the caster until it is slain. Only one such elemental 
can be summoned at a time; if it is slain, a new creature cannot be summoned for 
24 hours. 

\vspace{12pt}
\textbf{The Orbs of Dragonkind:} Each of these fabled orbs contains the essence 
and personality of an ancient dragon of a different variety (one for each of the 
major ten different chromatic and metallic dragons). The bearer of an \textit{Orb 
}can \textit{dominate }dragons of its particular variety within 500 feet (as \textit{dominate 
monster}), the dragon being forced to make a DC 25 Will save to resist. (Spell 
resistance is not useful against this effect.) Each \textit{Orb of Dragonkind }bestows 
upon the wielder the AC and saving throw bonuses of the dragon within. These values 
replace whatever values the character would otherwise have, whether they are better 
or worse. These values cannot be modified by any means short of ridding the character 
of the \textit{Orb. }A character possessing an \textit{Orb of Dragonkind }is immune 
to the breath weapon---but only the breath weapon---of the dragon variety keyed 
to the \textit{Orb. }Finally, a character possessing an \textit{Orb }can herself 
use the breath weapon of the dragon in the \textit{Orb }three times per day.

All \textit{Orbs of Dragonkind }can be used to communicate verbally and visually 
with the possessors of the other \textit{Orbs. }The owner of an \textit{Orb }knows 
whether there are dragons within 10 miles at all times. For dragons of the \textit{Orb'}s 
particular variety, the range is 100 miles. If within 1 mile of a dragon of the 
\textit{Orb'}s variety, the wielder can determine the exact location and age of 
the creature. The bearer of one of these \textit{Orbs }earns the enmity forever 
of all dragonkind for profiting by the enslavement of one of their kin, even if 
she later loses the item. 

Each \textit{Orb }also has an individual power that can be invoked once per round 
at 10th caster level.• 

\textit{Black Dragon Orb: Fly }(Will DC 17 negates).• 

\textit{Blue Dragon Orb: Haste }(Fortitude DC 17 negates)\textit{.• }

\textit{Brass Dragon Orb: Teleport }(Will DC 19 negates)\textit{.• }

\textit{Bronze Dragon Orb: Scrying }(Will DC 18 negates)\textit{.• }

\textit{Copper Dragon Orb: Suggestion }(Will DC 17 negates)\textit{.• }

\textit{Gold Dragon Orb: }The owner of the gold \textit{Orb }can call upon any 
power possessed by one of the other \textit{Orbs---}including the \textit{dominate 
}and breath weapon abilities but not AC, save bonuses, or breath weapon immunity---but 
can only use an individual

power once per day. She can use \textit{dominate }on any other possessor of an 
\textit{Orb }within 1 mile (Will DC 23 negates).• 

\textit{Green Dragon Orb: Spectral hand.• }

\textit{Red Dragon Orb: Wall of fire.• }

\textit{Silver Dragon Orb: Cure critical wounds }(Will DC 18 half )\textit{.•

\textit{White Dragon Orb: Protection from energy (cold) }(Fortitude DC 17 negates)\textit{.}

\textbf{The Saint's Mace: }This relic appears to be a simple, well-used cudgel, 
but its simple appearance hides great power. The \textit{saint's mace }has a +5 
enhancement bonus and functions as a heavy mace with the holy, lawful, and disruption 
special abilities. The wielder can project \textit{searing light }from the mace 
at will, at caster level 20th.

\vspace{12pt}
\textbf{The Shadowstaff:} This artifact was crafted centuries ago, weaving together 
the wispy strands of shadow itself into a twisted black staff. The \textit{Shadowstaff 
}makes the wielder slightly shadowy and incorporeal, granting him a +4 bonus to 
AC and Reflex saves (which stacks with any other bonuses). However, in bright light 
(such as that of the sun, but not a torch) or in absolute darkness, the wielder 
takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, saves, and checks. 

The \textit{Shadowstaff }also has these powers.• 

\textit{Summon Shadows: }Three times per day the staff may summon 2d4 shadows. 
Immune to turning, they serve the wielder as if called by a \textit{summon monster 
V }spell cast at 20th level.• 

\textit{Summon Nightshade: }Once per month, the staff can summon a nightcrawler 
nightshade that serves the wielder as if called by a \textit{summon monster IX 
}spell cast at 20th level.• 

\textit{Shadow Form: }Three times per day the wielder can become a living shadow, 
with all the movement powers granted by the

\textit{gaseous form }spell. • 

\textit{Shadow Bolt: }Three times per day the staff can project a ray attack that 
deals 10d6 points of cold damage to a single target. The shadow bolt has a range 
of 100 feet.

\vspace{12pt}
The Shield of the Sun: This \textit{+5 large shield, }emblazoned with the symbol 
of the sun, allows the wielder to cast spells as if she were a 20th-level paladin 
with a Wisdom score of 20. The spells gained are cumulative with any existing spells 
per day that the character might have, even if she's already a paladin. The \textit{Shield 
of the Sun }also grants spell resistance 15 to its wielder. It absorbs the first 
10 points of damage from any energy attack (fire, cold, acid, electricity, or sonic). 
In return for all this, once per year the shield's owner must undertake a quest 
(no saving throw to avoid) at the behest of a lawful good deity. 

A character who is evil or chaotic (LE, NE, CE, CN, CG) gains four negative levels 
if she attempts to use this artifact. Although these negative levels never results 
in actual level loss, they remain as long as the shield is in hand and cannot be 
overcome in any way (including \textit{restoration }spells). The negative levels 
disappear when the shield is stowed or leaves the wearer's possession.
