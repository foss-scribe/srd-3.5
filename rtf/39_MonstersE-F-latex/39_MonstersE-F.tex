A typical giant eagle stands about 10 feet tall, has a wingspan of up to 20 feet, 
and resembles its smaller cousins in nearly every way except size. It weighs about 
500 pounds.

Giant eagles speak Common and Auran.

COMBAT

A giant eagle typically attacks from a great height, diving earthward at tremendous 
speed. When it cannot dive, it uses its powerful talons and slashing beak to strike 
at its target's head and eyes.

A solitary giant eagle is typically hunting or patrolling in the vicinity of its 
nest and generally ignores creatures that do not appear threatening. A mated pair 
attacks in concert, making repeated diving attacks to drive away intruders, and 
fights to the death to defend their nest or hatchlings.

\textbf{Evasion (Ex):} With a successful Reflex save against an attack that allows 
a Reflex save for half damage, a giant eagle takes no damage.

\textbf{Skills:} Giant eagles have a +4 racial bonus on Spot checks. 

TRAINING A GIANT EAGLE

Although intelligent, a giant eagle requires training before it can bear a rider 
in combat. To be trained, a giant eagle must have a friendly attitude toward the 
trainer (this can be achieved through a successful Diplomacy check). Training a 
friendly giant eagle requires six weeks of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check. 

Riding a giant eagle requires an exotic saddle. A giant eagle can fight while carrying 
a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check.

Giant eagle eggs are worth 2,500 gp apiece on the open market, while chicks are 
worth 4,000 gp each. Professional trainers charge 1,000 gp to rear or train a giant 
eagle.

Carrying Capacity: A light load for a giant eagle is up to 300 pounds; a medium 
load, 301-600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601-900 pounds.

Air elementals speak Auran, though they rarely choose to do so. 

Combat

Their rapid speed makes air elementals useful on vast battlefields or in extended 
aerial combat.

\textbf{Air Mastery (Ex):} Airborne creatures take a -1 penalty on attack and damage 
rolls against an air elemental.

\textbf{Whirlwind (Su): }The elemental can transform itself into a whirlwind once 
every 10 minutes and remain in that form for up to 1 round for every 2 HD it has. 
In this form, the elemental can move through the air or along a surface at its 
fly speed.

The whirlwind is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 30 feet wide at the top, and up 
to 50 feet tall, depending on the elemental's size. The elemental controls the 
exact height, but it must be at least 10 feet.

The elemental's movement while in whirlwind form does not provoke attacks of opportunity, 
even if the elemental enters the space another creature occupies. Another creature 
might be caught in the whirlwind if it touches or enters the whirlwind, or if the 
elemental moves into or through the creature's space.

Creatures one or more size categories smaller than the elemental might take damage 
when caught in the whirlwind (see the table below for details) and may be lifted 
into the air. An affected creature must succeed on a Reflex save when it comes 
into contact with the whirlwind or take the indicated damage. It must also succeed 
on a second Reflex save or be picked up bodily and held suspended in the powerful 
winds, automatically taking the indicated damage each round. A creature that can 
fly is allowed a Reflex save each round to escape the whirlwind. The creature still 
takes damage but can leave if the save is successful. The DC for saves against 
the whirlwind's effects varies with the elemental's size (see the table). The save 
DC is Strength based.

Creatures trapped in the whirlwind cannot move except to go where the elemental 
carries them or to escape the whirlwind.

Creatures caught in the whirlwind can otherwise act normally, but must succeed 
on a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell. Creatures caught 
in the whirlwind take a -4 penalty to Dexterity and a -2 penalty on attack rolls. 
The elemental can have only as many creatures trapped inside the whirlwind at one 
time as will fit inside the whirlwind's volume.

The elemental can eject any carried creatures whenever it wishes, depositing them 
wherever the whirlwind happens to be. A summoned elemental always ejects trapped 
creatures before returning to its home plane.

If the whirlwind's base touches the ground, it creates a swirling cloud of debris. 
This cloud is centered on the elemental and has a diameter equal to half the whirlwind's 
height. The cloud obscures all vision, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 
5 feet away have concealment, while those farther away have total concealment.

Those caught in the cloud must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell 
level) to cast a spell.

An elemental in whirlwind form cannot make slam attacks and does not threaten the 
area around it.

When summoned to the Material Plane, an earth elemental consists of whatever types 
of dirt, stones, precious metals, and gems it was conjured from.

Earth elementals speak Terran but rarely choose to do so.

Combat

Though an earth elemental moves slowly, it is a relentless opponent. It can travel 
though solid ground or stone as easily as humans walk on the earth's surface. It 
cannot swim, however, and must either walk around a body of water or go through 
the ground under it. An earth elemental can move along the bottom of a body of 
water but prefers not to.

\textbf{Earth Mastery (Ex): }An earth elemental gains a +1 bonus on attack and 
damage rolls if both it and its foe are touching the ground. If an opponent is 
airborne or waterborne, the elemental takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. 
(These modifiers are not included in the statistics block.)

\textbf{Push (Ex): }An earth elemental can start a bull rush maneuver without provoking 
an attack of opportunity. The combat modifiers given in Earth Mastery, above, also 
apply to the elemental's opposed Strength checks.

\textbf{Earth Glide (Ex):} An earth elemental can glide through stone, dirt, or 
almost any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through water. 
Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or 
other signs of its presence. A \textit{move earth }spell cast on an area containing 
a burrowing earth elemental flings the elemental back 30 feet, stunning the creature 
for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save.

A fire elemental cannot enter water or any other nonflammable liquid. A body of 
water is an impassible barrier unless the fire elemental can step or jump over 
it.

Fire elementals speak Ignan, though they rarely choose to do so.

Combat

A fire elemental is a fierce opponent that attacks its enemies directly and savagely. 
It takes joy in burning the creatures and objects of the Material Plane to ashes.

\textbf{Burn (Ex): }A fire elemental's slam attack deals bludgeoning damage plus 
fire damage from the elemental's flaming body. Those hit by a fire elemental`s 
slam attack also must succeed on a Reflex save or catch on fire. The flame burns 
for 1d4 rounds. The save DC varies with the elemental's size (see the table below). 
A burning creature can take a move action to put out the flame. The save DC is 
Constitution- based.

Creatures hitting a fire elemental with natural weapons or unarmed attacks take 
fire damage as though hit by the elemental's attack, and also catch on fire unless 
they succeed on a Reflex save.

A water elemental can't venture more than 180 feet from the body of water from 
which it was conjured.

Water elementals speak Aquan but rarely choose to do so.

Combat

A water elemental prefers to fight in a large body of water where it can disappear 
beneath the waves and suddenly swell up behind its opponents.

\textbf{Water Mastery (Ex): }A water elemental gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage 
rolls if both it and its opponent are touching water. If the opponent or the elemental 
is touching the ground, the elemental takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. 
(These modifiers are not included in the statistics block.)

A water elemental can be a serious threat to a ship that crosses its path. An elemental 
can easily overturn small craft (5 feet of length per Hit Die of the elemental) 
and stop larger vessels (10 feet long per HD). Even large ships (20 feet long per 
HD) can be slowed to half speed.

\textbf{Drench (Ex):} The elemental's touch puts out torches, campfires, exposed 
lanterns, and other open flames of nonmagical origin if these are of Large size 
or smaller. The creature can dispel magical fire it touches as \textit{dispel magic 
}(caster level equals elemental's HD).

\textbf{Vortex (Su):} The elemental can transform itself into a whirlpool once 
every 10 minutes, provided it is underwater, and remain in that form for up to 
1 round for every 2 HD it has. In vortex form, the elemental can move through the 
water or along the bottom at its swim speed. The vortex is 5 feet wide at the base, 
up to 30 feet wide at the top, and 10 feet or more tall, depending on the elemental's 
size. The elemental controls the exact height, but it must be at least 10 feet.

The elemental's movement while in vortex form does not provoke attacks of opportunity, 
even if the elemental enters the space another creature occupies. Another creature 
might be caught in the vortex if it touches or enters the vortex, or if the elemental 
moves into or through the creature's space.

Creatures one or more size categories smaller than the elemental might take damage 
when caught in the vortex (see the table below for details) and may be swept up 
by it. An affected creature must succeed on a Reflex save when it comes into contact 
with the vortex or take the indicated damage. It must also succeed on a second 
Reflex save or be picked up bodily and held suspended in the powerful currents, 
automatically taking damage each round. An affected creature is allowed a Reflex 
save each round to escape the vortex. The creature still takes damage, but can 
leave if the save is successful. The DC for saves against the vortex's effects 
varies with the elemental's size. The save DC is Strength-based.

Creatures trapped in the vortex cannot move except to go where the elemental carries 
them or to escape the whirlwind. Creatures caught in the whirlwind can otherwise 
act normally, but must make a Concentration check (DC 10 + spell level) to cast 
a spell. Creatures caught in the whirlwind take a -4 penalty to Dexterity and a 
-2 penalty on attack rolls. The elemental can have only as many creatures trapped 
inside the vortex at one time as will fit inside the vortex's volume.

The elemental can eject any carried creatures whenever it wishes, depositing them 
wherever the vortex happens to be. A summoned elemental always ejects trapped creatures 
before returning to its home plane.

If the vortex's base touches the bottom, it creates a swirling cloud of debris. 
This cloud is centered on the elemental and has a diameter equal to half the vortex's 
height. The cloud obscures all vision, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 
5 feet away have concealment, while those farther away have total concealment.

Those caught in the cloud must make a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) 
to cast a spell.

An elemental in vortex form cannot make slam attacks and does not threaten the 
area around it. 

Skills: A water elemental has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some 
special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, 
even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided 
it swims in a straight line.

Elves average 5 feet tall and typically weigh just over 100 pounds. They live on 
fruits and grains, though they occasionally hunt for fresh meat. Elves prefer colorful 
clothes, usually with a green-and-gray cloak that blends well with the colors of 
the forest.

Elves speak Elven, and most also know Common and Sylvan.

Most elves encountered outside their homes are warriors; the information presented 
here is for one of 1st level.

COMBAT

Elves are cautious warriors and take time to analyze their opponents and the location 
of the fight if at all possible, maximizing their advantage by using ambushes, 
snipers, and camouflage. They prefer to fire from cover and retreat before they 
are found, repeating this maneuver until all of their enemies are dead.

They prefer longbows, shortbows, rapiers, and longswords. In melee, elves are graceful 
and deadly, using complex maneuvers that are beautiful to observe. Their wizards 
often use \textit{sleep }spells during combat because these won't affect other 
elves.

\textbf{Elf Traits (Ex):} Elves possess the following racial traits.--- 

\parindent=3pt
+2 Dexterity, -2 Constitution.---

\parindent=0pt
Medium size.---

An elf 's base land speed is 30 feet.---

Immunity to \textit{sleep }spells and effects, and a +2 racial saving throw bonus 
against enchantment spells or effects.

(Not reflected in the saving throw modifiers given here.)---

Low-light vision.---

Weapon Proficiency: Elves are automatically proficient with the longsword, rapier, 
longbow, composite longbow, shortbow, and composite shortbow.--- 

\parindent=3pt
+2 racial bonus on Listen, Search, and Spot checks. An elf who merely passes within 
5 feet of a secret or concealed door is entitled to a Search check to notice it 
as if she were actively looking for it.---

\parindent=0pt
Automatic Languages: Common, Elven. Bonus Languages: Draconic, Gnoll, Gnome, Goblin, 
Orc, Sylvan.---

Favored Class: Wizard.

The elf warrior presented here had the following ability scores before racial adjustments: 
Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8.

SUBRACES

The above information describes the high elf, the most common variety. There are 
five other major subraces of elf, in addition to half-elves, who share enough elven 
characteristics to be included here.

\vspace{12pt}
\section*{\textbf{Half-Elf}}

Half-elves are not truly an elf subrace, but they are often mistaken for elves. 
Half-elves usually inherit a good blend of their parents' physical characteristics.

\textbf{Half-Elf Traits (Ex): }Half-elves possess the following racial traits.---

Medium size.---

A half-elf 's base land speed is 30 feet.---

Immunity to \textit{sleep }spells and similar magical effects, and a +2 racial 
bonus on saving throws against enchantment spells or effects.---

Low-light vision.--- 

\parindent=3pt
+1 racial bonus on Listen, Search, and Spot checks. A half-elf does not have the 
elf 's ability to notice secret doors simply by passing near them.--- 

+2 racial bonus on Diplomacy and Gather Information checks: Half-elves get along 
naturally with all people. This bonus may not apply in situations or settings where 
half-elves are viewed with distrust.---

Elven Blood: For all effects related to race, a half-elf is considered an elf. 
Half-elves, for example, are just as vulnerable to special effects that affect 
elves as their elf ancestors are, and they can use magic items that are only usable 
by elves.---

Automatic Languages: Common, Elven. Bonus Languages: Any (other than secret languages, 
such as Druidic).---

Favored Class: Any. When determining whether a multiclass half-elf takes an experience 
point penalty for multiclassing, her highest-level class does not count.

\vspace{12pt}
\section*{\textbf{Aquatic Elf}}

\parindent=0pt
Also called sea elves, these creatures are waterbreathing cousins to land-dwelling 
elves.

Aquatic elves fight underwater with tridents, spears, and nets.

\textbf{Aquatic Elf Traits (Ex):} These traits are in addition to the high elf 
traits, except where noted.--- 

\parindent=3pt
+2 Dexterity, -2 Intelligence. These adjustments replace the high elf 's ability 
score adjustments.---

\parindent=0pt
An aquatic elf has the aquatic subtype.---

An aquatic elf has a swim speed of 40 feet.---

Gills: Aquatic elves can survive out of the water for 1 hour per point of Constitution 
(after that, refer to the suffocation rules).---

Superior Low-Light Vision: Aquatic elves can see four times as far as a human in 
starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of low illumination. This 
trait replaces the high elf 's low-light vision.---

Favored Class: Fighter. This trait replaces the high elf 's favored class.

\vspace{12pt}
\section*{\textbf{Drow}}

Also known as dark elves, drow are a depraved and evil subterranean offshoot.

White is the most common hair color among drow, but almost any pale shade is possible. 
Drow tend to be smaller and thinner than other sorts of elves, and their eyes are 
often a vivid red. 

Drow usually coat their arrows with a potent venom.

\textbf{Poison (Ex):} An opponent hit by a drow's poisoned weapon must succeed 
on a DC 13 Fortitude save or fall unconscious. After 1 minute, the subject must 
succeed on another DC 13 Fortitude save or remain unconscious for 2d4 hours. A 
typical drow carries 1d4-1 doses of drow knockout poison. Drow typically coat arrows 
and crossbow bolts with this poison, but it can also be applied to a melee weapon. 
Note that drow have no special ability to apply poison without risking being poisoned 
themselves. Since this poison is not a magical effect, drow and other elves are 
susceptible to it.

\textbf{Drow Traits (Ex):} These traits are in addition to the high elf traits, 
except where noted.--- 

\parindent=3pt
+2 Intelligence, +2 Charisma.---

\parindent=0pt
Darkvision out to 120 feet. This trait replaces the high elf 's low-light vision.---

Spell resistance equal to 11 + class levels.--- 

\parindent=3pt
+2 racial bonus on Will saves against spells and spell-like abilities.---

\parindent=0pt
Spell-Like Abilities: Drow can use the following spell-like abilities once per 
day: \textit{dancing lights, darkness, faerie fire. }Caster level equals the drow's 
class levels.---

Weapon Proficiency: A drow is automatically proficient with the hand crossbow, 
the rapier, and the short sword. This trait replaces the high elf 's weapon proficiency.---

Automatic Languages: Common, Elven, Undercommon. Bonus Languages: Abyssal, Aquan, 
Draconic, Drow Sign Language, Gnome, Goblin. This trait replaces the high elf 's 
automatic and bonus languages.---

Light Blindness: Abrupt exposure to bright light (such as sunlight or a \textit{daylight 
}spell) blinds drow for 1 round. On subsequent rounds, they are dazzled as long 
as they remain in the affected area.---

Favored Class: Wizard (male) or cleric (female). This trait replaces the high elf 
's favored class.---

Level adjustment +2.

The drow warrior presented here had the following ability scores before racial 
adjustments: Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8.

Challenge Rating: Drow with levels in NPC classes have a CR equal to their character 
level. Drow with levels in PC classes have a CR equal to their character level 
+1.

\vspace{12pt}
\section*{\textbf{Gray Elf}}

Taller and grander in physical appearance than others of their race, gray elves 
have a reputation for being aloof and arrogant (even by elven standards). They 
have either silver hair and amber eyes or pale golden hair and violet eyes. They 
prefer clothing of white, silver, yellow, or gold, with cloaks of deep blue or 
purple.

\textbf{Gray Elf Traits (Ex):} These traits are in addition to the high elf traits.--- 

\parindent=3pt
+2 Intelligence, -2 Strength.

\vspace{12pt}
\section*{\textbf{Wild Elf}}

\parindent=0pt
Wild elves are barbaric and tribal. Wild elves' hair color ranges from black to 
light brown, lightening to silvery white with age. They dress in simple clothing 
of animal skins and basic plant weaves.

\textbf{Wild Elf Traits (Ex): }These traits are in addition to the high elf traits, 
except where noted.--- 

\parindent=3pt
+2 Dexterity, -2 Intelligence. These adjustments replace the high elf 's ability 
score adjustments.---

\parindent=0pt
Favored Class: Sorcerer. This trait replaces the high elf 's favored class.

\vspace{12pt}
\section*{\textbf{Wood Elf}}

Their hair color ranges from yellow to a coppery red, and they are more muscular 
than other elves. Their clothing is in dark shades of green and earth tones to 
better blend in with their natural surroundings.

\textbf{Wood Elf Traits (Ex):} These traits are in addition to the high elf traits, 
except where noted.--- 

\parindent=3pt
+2 Strength, -2 Intelligence.---

\parindent=0pt
Favored Class: Ranger. This trait replaces the high elf 's favored class.

Ethereal filchers are bizarre-looking creatures with a penchant for snatching trinkets 
from passersby. Their ability to move quickly between the Ethereal Plane and the 
Material Plane makes them spectacular pickpockets.

Ethereal filchers do not speak.

COMBAT

An ethereal filcher prowls about, using its ethereal jaunt ability to move about 
unseen (and often through solid objects). Upon locating a likely mark, it shifts 
to the Material Plane, attempting to catch its victim unaware. The creature attempts 
to seize an item, then retreats quickly back to the Ethereal Plane. It is not above 
delivering a bite to distract its target. Once it secures a trinket, it scurries 
back to its lair to admire its prize. When badly wounded, a filcher escapes rather 
than continuing the fight.

Any number of simple ruses can blunt a filcher's attack.

\textbf{Detect Magic (Su):} Ethereal filchers can detect magic as the spell (caster 
level 5th) at will.

\textbf{Ethereal Jaunt (Su): }An ethereal filcher can shift from the Ethereal Plane 
to the Material Plane as part of any move action, and shift back again as a free 
action. It can remain on the Ethereal Plane for 1 round before returning to the 
Material Plane. The ability is otherwise identical with the \textit{ethereal jaunt 
}spell (caster level 15th).

\textbf{Skills:} Ethereal filchers have a +8 racial bonus on Sleight of Hand checks, 
and a +4 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.

Ethereal marauders live and hunt on the Ethereal Plane. Ethereal marauders' coloration 
ranges from bright blue to deep violet. An ethereal marauder stands about 4 feet 
tall, but its overall length is about 7 feet. It weighs about 200 pounds.

Ethereal marauders speak no known languages. Survivors of their attacks on the 
Material Plane claim that they emit an eerie, high whine that varies in pitch depending 
on the creature's speed and health.

COMBAT

Once a marauder locates prey, it shifts to the Material Plane to attack, attempting 
to catch its victim flat-footed. The creature bites its victim, then retreats quickly 
back to the Ethereal Plane. When badly hurt or wounded, a marauder escapes to its 
home plane rather than continuing the fight.

\textbf{Ethereal Jaunt (Su):} An ethereal marauder can shift from the Ethereal 
Plane to the Material Plane as a free action, and shift back again as a move action. 
The ability is otherwise identical with the \textit{ethereal jaunt }spell (caster 
level 15th).

\textbf{Skills:} Ethereal marauders have a +2 racial bonus on Listen, Move Silently, 
and Spot checks.

An ettercap is about 6 feet tall and weighs about 200 pounds.

Ettercaps speak Common.

COMBAT

Ettercaps are not brave creatures, but their cunning traps often ensure that the 
enemy never draws a weapon. When an ettercap does engage its enemies, it attacks 
with its keen-edged claws and venomous bite. It usually will not come within melee 
reach of any foe that is still able to move.

\textbf{Poison (Ex):} Injury, Fortitude DC 15, initial damage 1d6 Dex, secondary 
damage 2d6 Dex. The save DC is Constitution based and includes a +2 racial bonus.

\textbf{Web (Ex):} An ettercap can throw a web eight times per day. This is similar 
to an attack with a net but has a maximum range of 50 feet, with a range increment 
of 10 feet, and is effective against targets of up to Medium size. The web anchors 
the target in place, allowing no movement.

An entangled creature can escape with a DC 13 Escape Artist check or burst the 
web with a DC 17 Strength check. The check DCs are Constitution-based, and the 
Strength check DC includes a +4 racial bonus. The web has 6 hit points, hardness 
0, and takes double damage from fire.

Ettercaps can also create sheets of sticky webbing from 5 to 60 feet square. They 
usually position these to snare flying creatures but can also try to trap prey 
on the ground. Approaching creatures must succeed on a DC 20 Spot check to notice 
a web, or they stumble into it and become trapped as though by a successful web 
attack. Attempts to escape or burst the webbing receive a +5 bonus if the trapped 
creature has something to walk on or grab while pulling free. Each 5-foot-square 
section has 6 hit points, hardness 0, and takes double damage from fire.

An ettercap can move across its own sheet web at its climb speed and can determine 
the exact location of any creature touching the web.

\textbf{Skills:} Ettercaps have a +4 racial bonus on Craft (trapmaking), Hide, 
and Spot checks. They have a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always choose 
to take 10 on Climb checks, even if rushed or threatened.

Ettins, or two-headed giants, are vicious and unpredictable hunters that stalk 
the night.

An ettin never bathes if it can help it, which usually leaves it so grimy and dirty 
its skin resembles thick, gray hide. Adult ettins are about 13 feet tall and weigh 
5,200 pounds. They live about 75 years.

Ettins have no language of their own but speak a pidgin of Orc, Goblin, and Giant. 
Creatures that can speak any of these languages must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence 
check to communicate with an ettin. Check once for each bit of information: If 
the other creature speaks two of these languages, the DC is 10, and for someone 
who speaks all three, the DC is 5. 

COMBAT

Though ettins aren't very intelligent, they are cunning fighters.

They prefer to ambush their victims rather than charge into a straight fight, but 
once the battle has started, an ettin usually fights furiously until all enemies 
are dead.

\textbf{Superior Two-Weapon Fighting (Ex):} An ettin fights with a morningstar 
or javelin in each hand. Because each of its two heads controls an arm, the ettin 
does not take a penalty on attack or damage rolls for attacking with two weapons.

Skills: An ettin's two heads give it a +2 racial bonus on Listen, Spot, and Search 
checks.

\vspace{12pt}
{\LARGE{}FIENDISH CREATURE}

Fiendish creatures dwell on the lower planes, the realms of evil, although they 
resemble beings found on the Material Plane. They are more fearsome in appearance 
than their earthly counterparts.

\vspace{12pt}
CREATING A FIENDISH CREATURE

``Fiendish'' is an inherited template that can be added to any corporeal aberration, 
animal, dragon, fey, giant, humanoid, magical beast, monstrous humanoid, ooze, 
plant, or vermin of nongood alignment (referred to

hereafter as the base creature).

A fiendish creature uses all the base creature's statistics and abilities except 
as noted here. Do not recalculate the creature's Hit Dice, base attack bonus, saves, 
or skill points if its type changes.

\textbf{Size and Type:} Animals or vermin with this template become magical beasts, 
but otherwise the creature type is unchanged. Size is unchanged. Fiendish creatures 
encountered on the Material Plane have the extraplanar subtype.

\textbf{Special Attacks: }A fiendish creature retains all the special attacks of 
the base creature and also gains the following special attack.

\textit{\textbf{Smite Good (Su):}}\textit{ }Once per day the creature can make 
a normal melee attack to deal extra damage equal to its HD total (maximum of +20) 
against a good foe.

\textbf{Special Qualities:} A fiendish creature retains all the special qualities 
of the base creature and also gains the following.---

Darkvision out to 60 feet.---

Damage reduction (see the table below). ---

Resistance to cold and fire (see the table below).---

Spell resistance equal to the creature's HD + 5 (maximum 25).

If the base creature already has one or more of these special qualities, use the 
better value.

If a fiendish creature gains damage reduction, its natural weapons are treated 
as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

\textbf{Abilities:} Same as the base creature, but Intelligence is at least 3.

\textbf{Environment:} Any evil-aligned plane.

\textbf{Challenge Rating:} HD 3 or less, as base creature; HD 4 to 7, as

base creature +1; HD 8 or more, as base creature +2.

\textbf{Alignment: }Always evil (any).

\textbf{Level Adjustment:} Same as the base creature +2.

\vspace{12pt}
A formian resembles a cross between an ant and a centaur. All formians are covered 
in a brownish-red carapace; size and appearance differs for each variety.

COMBAT

Formians are generally aggressive, seeking to subdue all they encounter. If they 
perceive even the slightest threat to their hive-city or to their queen, they attack 
immediately and fight to the death. Any formian also attacks immediately if ordered 
to do so by a superior.

\textbf{Hive Mind (Ex):} All formians within 50 miles of their queen are in constant 
communication. If one is aware of a particular danger, they all are. If one in 
a group is not flatfooted, none of them are. No formian in a group is considered 
flanked unless all of them are.

WORKER

While workers cannot speak, they can convey simple concepts (such as danger) by 
body movements. Through the hive mind, however, they can communicate just fine---although 
their intelligence still limits the concepts that they can grasp.

A worker is about 3 feet long and about 2-1/2 feet high at the front. It weighs 
about 60 pounds. Its hands are suitable only for manual labor.

Combat

Formian workers fight only to defend their hive-cities, using their mandibled bite.

A formian worker's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated 
as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

\textit{\textbf{Cure Serious Wounds }}\textbf{(Sp):} Eight workers together can 
heal a creature's wounds as though using the \textit{cure serious wounds }spell 
(caster level 7th). This is a full-round action for all eight workers.

\textit{\textbf{Make Whole }}\textbf{(Sp):} Three workers together can repair an 
object as though using the \textit{make whole }spell (caster level 7th). This is 
a fullround action for all three workers.

WARRIOR

Warriors communicate through the hive mind to convey battle plans and make reports 
to their commanders. They cannot speak otherwise.

A warrior is about is about 5 feet long and about 4-1/2 feet high at the front. 
It weighs about 180 pounds.

Combat

Warriors are wicked combatants, using claws, bite, and a poisonous sting all at 
once. Through the hive mind, they attack with coordinated and extremely efficient 
tactics.

A formian warrior's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated 
as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

\textbf{Poison (Ex):} Injury, Fortitude DC 14, initial and secondary damage 1d6 
Str. The save DC is Constitution-based.

TASKMASTER

These formians communicate only telepathically and derive sustenance from the mental 
energies of those they dominate.

A taskmaster is about the same size as a warrior.

Combat

Taskmasters rely on their dominated slaves to fight for them if at all possible. 
If necessary, though, they can defend themselves with claws and a poison sting.

A formian taskmaster's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated 
as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

\textbf{Dominate Monster (Su):} A taskmaster can use a \textit{dominate monster 
}ability as the spell from a 10th-level caster (Will DC 17 negates), although the 
subject may be of any kind and may be up to Large size. Creatures that successfully 
save cannot be affected by the same taskmaster's dominate monster ability for 24 
hours. A single taskmaster can dominate up to four subjects at a time. The save 
DC is Charisma-based.

\textbf{Dominated Creature (Ex):} A taskmaster is never encountered alone. One 
dominated nonformian creature always accompanies it (choose or determine randomly 
any creature of CR 4). 

\textbf{Poison (Ex):} Injury, Fortitude DC 15, initial and secondary damage 1d6 
Str. The save DC is Constitution-based.

MYRMARCH

Myrmarchs are the elite of formian society. Much more than those beneath them, 
these creatures are individuals, with goals, desires, and creative thought. 

A myrmarch is about is about 7 feet long and about 5-1/2 feet high at the front. 
It weighs about 1,500 pounds. Its claws are capable of fine manipulation, like 
human hands. Each myrmarch wears a bronze helm to signify its position (the more 
elaborate the helm, the more prestigious the position).

Myrmarchs speak Formian and Common.

Combat

Myrmarchs' claws are like hands and thus serve no combat purpose.

Myrmarchs occasionally employ javelins for ranged attacks, coated with poison from 
their own stingers.

They fight intelligently, aiding those under them (if any such are present) and 
commanding them through the hive mind. If chaotic creatures are present, however, 
a myrmarch is singleminded in its quest to destroy them.

A formian myrmarch's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated 
as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

\textbf{Poison (Ex):} Injury, Fortitude DC 20, initial and secondary damage 2d6 
Dex. The save DC is Constitution-based.

\textbf{Spell-Like Abilities:} At will---\textit{charm monster }(DC 17), \textit{clairaudience/ 
clairvoyance, detect chaos, detect thoughts }(DC 15), \textit{magic circle against 
chaos}, \textit{greater teleport; }1/day---\textit{dictum }(DC 20), \textit{order's 
wrath }(DC 17). Caster level 12th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

QUEEN

The formian queen cannot move. With her telepathic abilities, though, she can send 
instructions to and get reports from any formian within her range. 

She is about 10 feet long, perhaps 4 feet high, and weighs about 3,500 pounds.

The queen speaks Formian and Common, although she can communicate with any creature 
telepathically.

Combat

The queen does not fight. She has no ability to move. If necessary, a team of workers 
and myrmarchs (or dominated slaves) haul her enormous bulk to where she needs to 
go. This sort of occurrence is very rare, however, and most of the time the queen 
remains within her well-defended chambers.

Despite her utter lack of physical activity, the queen can cast spells and use 
spell-like abilities to great effect in her own defense as well as the defense 
of the hive-city.

\textbf{Spells:} The queen casts arcane spells as a 17th-level sorcerer.

\textit{Typical Sorcerer Spells Known }(6/8/7/7/7/7/6/6/4, base save DC 15 + spell 
level): 0---\textit{acid splash, arcane mark, daze, detect magic, light, mage hand, 
read magic, resistance, touch of fatigue; }1st---\textit{comprehend languages, 
identify, mage armor, magic missile, shield; }2nd--- \textit{hypnotic pattern, 
invisibility, protection from arrows, resist energy, scorching ray; }3rd---\textit{dispel

against chaos, order's wrath }(DC 19), \textit{shield of law }(DC 23), \textit{true 
seeing. }Caster level 17th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

\textbf{Telepathy (Su):} The queen can communicate telepathically with any intelligent 
creature within 50 miles whose presence she is aware of.

A frost worn cannot burrow through stone, but can manage ice and frozen earth. 
When moving through such hard materials it leaves behind a usable tunnel about 
5 feet in diameter.

A frost worm is about 40 feet long, 5 feet in diameter, and weighs about 8,000 
pounds.

COMBAT

Frost worms lurk under the snow, waiting for prey to come near.

They begin an attack with a trill and then set upon helpless prey with their bite.

\textbf{Trill (Su): }A frost worm can emit a noise that forces its prey to stand 
motionless. This sonic mind-affecting compulsion affects all creatures other than 
frost worms within a 100-foot radius. Creatures must succeed on a DC 17 Will save 
or be stunned for as long as the worm trills and for 1d4 rounds thereafter, even 
if they are attacked. However, if attacked or violently shaken (a full-round action), 
a victim is allowed another saving throw. Once a creature has resisted or broken 
the effect, it cannot be affected again by that same frost worm's trill for 24 
hours. The effect's caster level is 14th. The save DC is Charisma-based.

\textbf{Cold (Ex):} A frost worm's body generates intense cold, causing opponents 
to take an extra 1d8 points of cold damage every time the creature succeeds on 
a bite attack. Creatures attacking a frost worm unarmed or with natural weapons 
take this same cold damage each time one of their attacks hits.

\textbf{Breath Weapon (Su):} 30-foot cone, once per hour, damage 15d6 cold, Reflex 
DC 22 half. Opponents held motionless by the frost worm's trill get no saving throw. 
The save DC is Constitution-based. 

\textbf{Death Throes (Ex): }When killed, a frost worm turns to ice and shatters 
in an explosion that deals 12d6 points of cold damage and 8d6 points of piercing 
damage to everything within 100 feet (Reflex half DC 22). The save DC is Constitution-based. 

\textbf{Skills:} *A frost worm, due to its coloration and its affinity for burying 
itself in the snow, has a +10 racial bonus on Hide checks in its native environment.

COMBAT

Shriekers and violet fungi often work together to attract and kill prey. When the 
shriekers' hellish racket attracts a curious creature, the violet fungus tries 
to kill it. Both creatures enjoy the fruits of a successful hunt.

SHRIEKER

A shrieker is a stationary fungus that emits a loud noise to attract prey or when 
disturbed. Shriekers live in dark, subterranean places, often in the company of 
violet fungi, whose poison they are immune to.

Shriekers come in of shades of purple.

Combat

A shrieker has no means of attack. Instead, it lures prey to its vicinity by emitting 
a loud noise.

\textbf{Shriek (Ex):} Movement or a light source within 10 feet of a shrieker causes 
the fungus to emit a piercing sound that lasts for 1d3 rounds. The sound attracts 
nearby creatures that are disposed to investigate it. Some creatures that live 
near shriekers come to learn that the fungus's noise means there is food nearby.

VIOLET FUNGUS

Violet fungi resemble shriekers and are often found growing among them.

A violet fungi's coloration ranges from purple overall to dull gray or violet covered 
with purple spots.

Combat

A violet fungus flails about with its tentacles at living creatures that come within 
its reach.

\textbf{Poison (Ex):} Injury, Fortitude DC 14, initial and secondary damage 1d4 
Str and 1d4 Con. The save DC is Constitution-based.
