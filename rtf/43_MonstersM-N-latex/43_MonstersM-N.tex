Magmins are small, human-shaped beings from the Elemental Plane of Fire that radiate 
intense heat and are wreathed in an aura of searing flames. A typical magmin is 
4 feet tall and weighs 400 pounds.

Magmins speak Ignan.

COMBAT

Although small, magmins are dangerous opponents. Their touch is effective against 
those who lack protection or immunity from heat and flames, but if faced with opponents 
who have immunity to fire, magmins rely on their slam attack. In any case, magmins 
are not valiant fighters. They usually flee if injured, although often only far 
enough to set up a fiery ambush for their enemies.

A magmin's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming 
damage reduction.

\textbf{Combustion (Ex):} Anyone a magmin touches must succeed on a DC 12 Reflex 
save or take an extra 1d8 points of fire damage as clothes ignite or armor becomes 
searing hot. The damage continues for another 1d4+2 rounds after the magmin's last 
successful attack. Magmins can also ignite flammable materials with a touch. The 
save DC is Constitution-based.

\textbf{Fiery Aura (Ex): }Anyone within 20 feet of a magmin must succeed on a DC 
12 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of heat damage per round from the intense 
heat. The save DC is Constitution-based.

\textbf{Melt Weapons (Ex):} Any metal weapon that strikes a magmin must succeed 
on a DC 12 Fortitude save or melt away into slag. The save DC is Constitution-based.

A typical manticore is about 10 feet long and weighs about 1,000 pounds. Manticores 
speak Common.

COMBAT

A manticore begins most attacks with a volley of spikes, then closes. In the outdoors, 
it often uses its powerful wings to stay aloft during battle.

\textbf{Spikes (Ex):} With a snap of its tail, a manticore can loose a volley of 
six spikes as a standard action (make an attack roll for each spike). This attack 
has a range of 180 feet with no range increment. All targets must be within 30 
feet of each other. The creature can launch only twenty-four spikes in any 24-hour 
period.

\textbf{Skills: }*Manticores have a +4 racial bonus on Spot checks.

A medusa is indistinguishable from a normal human at distances greater than 30 
feet (or closer, if its face is concealed). The creature often wears garments that 
enhance its body while hiding

its face behind a hood or veil.

A typical medusa is 5 to 6 feet tall and about the same weight as a human.

Medusas speak Common.

COMBAT

A medusa tries to disguise its true nature until the intended victim is within 
range of its petrifying gaze, using subterfuge and bluffing games to convince the 
target that there is no danger. It uses normal weapons to attack those who avert 
their eyes or survive its gaze, while its poisonous snakes strike at adjacent opponents.

\textbf{Petrifying Gaze (Su):} Turn to stone permanently, 30 feet, Fortitude DC 
15 negates. The save DC is Charisma-based.

\textbf{Poison (Ex):} Injury, Fortitude DC 14, initial damage 1d6 Str, secondary 
damage 2d6 Str. The save DC is Constitution-based.

\vspace{12pt}
{\LARGE{}MEPHIT}

Mephits are minor creatures from the elemental planes. 

All mephits appear as small, winged creatures with more or less humanoid features. 
While they are often described as impish, their elemental origins are apparent 
at first glance.

COMBAT

All mephits fight by biting and clawing or by using a breath weapon, the nature 
and effects of which vary from creature to creature.

A mephit's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming 
damage reduction.

\textbf{Breath Weapon (Su):} A mephit can use its breath weapon once every 1d4 
rounds as a standard action. See the individual descriptions for details.

\textbf{Spell-Like Abilities:} All mephits have one or more spell-like abilities 
(save DC 12 + spell level). See the individual descriptions for details.

\textit{\textbf{Summon Mephit }}\textbf{(Sp):} Once per day, a mephit can attempt 
to summon another mephit of the same variety, much as though casting a \textit{summon 
monster }spell, but with only a 25\% chance of success. Roll d\%: On a failure, 
no creature answers the summons that day. A mephit that has just been summoned 
cannot use its own summon ability for 1 hour. This ability is the equivalent of 
a 2nd-level spell.

\textbf{Fast Healing (Ex):} Mephits heal 2 points of damage each round, provided 
they are still alive and certain other conditions are met. See the individual descriptions 
for details.

3rd). Once per day it can create a mass of roiling dust that duplicates the effect 
of \textit{wind wall }(DC 15, caster level 6th). The save DC is Charisma-based.

kind. Each one is about 4 feet tall and weighs about 2 pounds.

Steam mephits speak Common and Ignan.

Combat

Unlike other mephits, steam mephits rush into combat eagerly, driven by an oversized 
ego.

\textbf{Breath Weapon (Su):} 10-foot cone of steam, damage 1d4 fire, Reflex DC 
12 half. Living creatures that fail their saves are tormented by burned skin and 
seared eyes unless they have immunity to fire or are otherwise protected. This

The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +1 racial bonus.

\textbf{Spell-Like Abilities: }Once per hour a steam mephit can surround itself 
with a plume of vapor, duplicating the effect of a \textit{blur }spell (caster 
level 3rd). Once per day it can create a rainstorm of boiling water that affects 
a 20-foot-square area. Living creatures caught in the storm take 2d6 points of 
fire damage (Reflex DC 14 half; caster level 6th). This ability is the equivalent 
of a 2nd-level spell. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

A merfolk is about 8 feet long from the top of the head to the end of the tail, 
and weighs about 400 pounds.

Merfolk speak Common and Aquan.

Most merfolk encountered outside their home are warriors; the information in the 
statistics block is for one of 1st level.

COMBAT

Merfolk favor heavy crossbows of shell and coral that fire bolts fashioned from 
blowfish spines, with an underwater range increment of 30 feet. Merfolk often barrage 
their enemies before closing, when they resort to tridents.

\textbf{Amphibious (Ex): }Merfolk can breathe both air and water, although they 
rarely travel more than a few feet from the water's edge. 

\textbf{Skills:} A merfolk has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some 
special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, 
even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided 
it swims in a straight line.

The merfolk warrior presented here had the following ability scores before racial 
adjustments: Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8.

A mimic can have almost any dimensions, but usually is not more than 10 feet long. 
A typical mimic has a volume of 150 cubic feet (5 feet by 5 feet by 6 feet) and 
weighs about 4,500 pounds. 

Mimics speak Common.

COMBAT

A mimic often surprises an unsuspecting adventurer, lashing out with a heavy pseudopod. 
The creature does not necessarily fight to the death if it can succeed in extorting 
treasure or food from a party.

\textbf{Adhesive (Ex): }A mimic exudes a thick slime that acts as a powerful adhesive, 
holding fast any creatures or items that touch it. An adhesive-covered mimic automatically 
grapples any creature it hits with its slam attack. Opponents so grappled cannot 
get free while the mimic is alive without removing the adhesive first.

A weapon that strikes an adhesive-coated mimic is stuck fast unless the wielder 
succeeds on a DC 16 Reflex save. A successful DC 16 Strength check is needed to 
pry it off.

Strong alcohol dissolves the adhesive, but the mimic still can grapple normally. 
A mimic can dissolve its adhesive at will, and the substance breaks down 5 rounds 
after the creature dies.

\textbf{Crush (Ex): }A mimic deals 1d8+4 points of damage with a successful grapple 
check.

\textbf{Mimic Shape (Ex): }A mimic can assume the general shape of any object that 
fills roughly 150 cubic feet (5 feet by 5 feet by 6 feet), such as a massive chest, 
a stout bed, or a wide door frame. The creature cannot substantially alter its 
size, though. A mimic's body is hard and has a rough texture, no matter what appearance 
it might present. Anyone who examines the mimic can detect the ruse with a successful 
Spot check opposed by the mimic's Disguise check. Of course, by this time it is 
generally far too late.

\textbf{Skills: }A mimic has a +8 racial bonus on Disguise checks.

A minotaur stands more than 7 feet tall and weighs about 700 pounds.

Minotaurs speak Giant.

COMBAT

Minotaurs prefer melee combat, where their great strength serves them well.

\textbf{Powerful Charge (Ex): }A minotaur typically begins a battle by charging 
at an opponent, lowering its head to bring its mighty horns into play. In addition 
to the normal benefits and hazards of a charge, this allows the beast to make a 
single gore attack with a +9 attack bonus that deals 4d6+6 points of damage.

\textbf{Natural Cunning (Ex): }Although minotaurs are not especially intelligent, 
they possess innate cunning and logical ability. This gives them immunity to \textit{maze 
}spells, prevents them from ever becoming lost, and enables them to track enemies. 
Further, they are never caught flat-footed.

\textbf{Skills:} Minotaurs have a +4 racial bonus on Search, Spot, and Listen checks.

of Fort +2, Ref +5, and Will +5. ---

Racial Skills: A minotaur's monstrous humanoid levels give it skill points equal 
to 9 x $ $(2 + Int modifier, minimum 1). Its class skills are Intimidate, Jump,

Mohrgs are the animated corpses of mass murderers or similar villains who died 
without atoning for their crimes. Most mohrgs are 5 to 6 feet tall and weigh about 
120 pounds.

COMBAT

Like zombies, mohrgs attack by slamming enemies with their fists. They often catch 
opponents flat-footed, for they move much faster than zombies.

\textbf{Improved Grab (Ex): }To use this ability, a mohrg must hit a creature of 
its size or smaller with its slam attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple 
as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.

\textbf{Paralyzing Touch (Su): }A mohrg lashes out with its tongue in combat. An 
opponent the tongue touches must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or become paralyzed 
for 1d4 minutes. The save DC is Charisma-based. \textbf{Create Spawn (Su): }Creatures 
killed by a mohrg rise after 1d4 days as zombies under the morhg's control. They 
do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.

Mummies are preserved corpses animated through the auspices of dark desert gods 
best forgotten. 

Most mummies are 5 to 6 feet tall and weigh about 120 pounds.

Mummies can speak Common, but seldom bother to do so.

COMBAT

\textbf{Despair (Su): }At the mere sight of a mummy, the viewer must succeed on 
a DC 16 Will save or be paralyzed with fear for 1d4 rounds. Whether or not the 
save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by the same mummy's 
despair ability for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.

\textbf{Mummy Rot (Su):} Supernatural disease---slam, Fortitude DC 16, incubation 
period 1 minute; damage 1d6 Con and 1d6 Cha. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Unlike normal diseases, mummy rot continues until the victim reaches Constitution 
0 (and dies) or is cured as described below. 

Mummy rot is a powerful curse, not a natural disease. A character attempting to 
cast any conjuration (healing) spell on a creature afflicted with mummy rot must 
succeed on a DC 20 caster level check, or the spell has no effect on the afflicted 
character.

To eliminate mummy rot, the curse must first be broken with \textit{break enchantment 
}or \textit{remove curse }(requiring a DC 20 caster level check for either spell), 
after which a caster level check is no longer necessary to cast healing spells 
on the victim, and the mummy rot can be magically cured as any normal disease.

An afflicted creature who dies of mummy rot shrivels away into sand and dust that 
blow away into nothing at the first wind.

\vspace{12pt}
MUMMY LORD

Unusually powerful or evil individuals preserved as mummies sometimes rise as greater 
mummies after death. A mummy lord resembles its lesser fellows, but often wears 
or carries equipment it used in life.

Mummy lords are often potent spellcasters. They are found as guardians of the tombs 
of high lords, priests, and mages. Most are sworn to defend for eternity the resting 
place of those whom they served in life, but in some cases a mummy lord's unliving 
state is the result of a terrible curse or rite designed to punish treason, infidelity, 
or crimes of an even more abhorrent nature. A mummy lord of this sort is usually 
imprisoned in a tomb that is never meant to be opened again.

\textbf{Despair (Su):} The save DC against this mummy lord's despair is 17.

\textbf{Mummy Rot (Su): }The save DC against this mummy lord's mummy rot is 17.

\textit{Typical Cleric Spells Prepared }(6/7/6/5/5/4; save DC 15 + spell level): 
0---\textit{detect magic }(2), \textit{guidance, read magic, resistance, virtue; 
}1st---\textit{bane, command, deathwatch, divine favor, doom, sanctuary*, shield 
of faith; }2nd---\textit{bull's strength, death knell*, hold person, resist energy,

spell resistance, symbol of pain.}

*Domain Spell. Domains: Death and Protection.

Possessions: +2 half-plate armor, cloak of resistance +2, ring of minor elemental 
resistance (fire), brooch of shielding. (Different mummy lords may have different 
possessions.)

\subsection*{{\LARGE{}NAGA}}

All nagas have long, snakelike bodies covered with glistening scales, and more 
or less human faces. They range in length from 10 to 20 feet and weigh from 200 
to 500 pounds. The eyes of a naga are bright and intelligent, burning with an almost 
hypnotic inner light.

COMBAT

Nagas favor spells over other forms of combat. Because they are almost always found 
in the lairs they guard and know well, they can arrange most encounters to suit 
their wishes.

Guardian nagas speak Celestial and Common.

Combat

Guardian nagas usually warn off intruders before attacking. If the warning is ignored, 
they may begin a spell assault or spit poison.

\textbf{Poison (Ex): }Injury or contact, Fortitude DC 19, initial and secondary 
damage 1d10 Con. The save DC is Constitution-based.

\textbf{Spit (Ex):} A guardian naga can spit its venom up to 30 feet as a standard 
action. This is a ranged touch attack with no range increment. Opponents hit by 
this attack must make successful saves (see above) to avoid the effect.

\textbf{Spells: }Guardian nagas cast spells as 9th-level sorcerers, and can also 
cast spells from the cleric list and from the Good and Law domains. The cleric 
spells and domain spells are considered arcane spells for a guardian naga, meaning 
that the creature does not need a divine focus to cast them.

\textit{Typical Spells Known }(6/7/7/7/5; save DC 14 + spell level): 0--- \textit{cure 
minor wounds, daze, detect magic, light, mage hand, open/close, ray of frost, read

A night hag is about the same height and weight as a female human.

Night hags speak Abyssal, Celestial, Common, and Infernal.

COMBAT

Night hags attack good creatures on sight if the odds of success seem favorable.

These creatures rip through armor and flesh with their deadly teeth. They love 
to use \textit{sleep }and then strangle those who are overcome by it.

A night hag's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as 
evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Its natural weapons 
are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

\textbf{Disease (Ex): }Demon fever---bite, Fortitude DC 18, incubation period 1 
day, damage 1d6 Con. Each day after the first, on a failed save, an afflicted creature 
must immediately succeed on another DC 18 Fortitude save or take 1 point of Constitution 
drain. The save DC is Constitution based.

\textbf{Spell-Like Abilities: }At will---\textit{detect chaos, detect evil, detect 
good, detect law, detect magic, magic missile, polymorph }(self only), \textit{ray 
of enfeeblement }(DC 12)\textit{, sleep }(DC 12)\textit{. }Caster level 8th. A 
night hag can use \textit{etherealness }at will (caster level 16th) so long as 
it possesses its \textit{heartstone }(see below). The save DCs are Charisma-based.

\textbf{Dream Haunting (Su): }Night hags can visit the dreams of chaotic or evil 
individuals by using a special periapt known as a \textit{heartstone }to become 
ethereal, then hovering over the creature. Once a hag invades someone's dreams, 
it rides on the victim's back until dawn. The sleeper suffers from tormenting dreams 
and takes 1 point of Constitution drain upon awakening. Only another ethereal being 
can stop these nocturnal intrusions, by confronting and defeating the night hag.

{\large{}HEARTSTONE}

All night hags carry a periapt known as a \textit{heartstone, }which instantly 
cures any disease contracted by the holder. In addition, a \textit{heartstone }provides 
a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws (this bonus is included in the statistics 
block). A night hag that loses this charm can no longer use \textit{etherealness 
}until it can manufacture another (which takes one month). Creatures other than 
the hag can benefit from the \textit{heartstone'}s powers, but the periapt shatters 
after ten uses (any disease cured or saving throw affected

counts as a use) and it does not bestow \textit{etherealness }to a bearer that 
is not a night hag. If sold, an intact \textit{heartstone }brings 1,800 gp.

A nightmare is about the size of a light war horse.

COMBAT

A nightmare can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also fight unless 
he or she succeeds on a Ride check.

A nightmare's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as 
evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

\textbf{Flaming Hooves (Su):} A blow from a nightmare's hooves sets combustible 
materials alight.

\textbf{Smoke (Su):} During the excitement of battle, a nightmare snorts and neighs 
with rage. This snorting fills a 15-foot cone with a hot, sulfurous smoke that 
chokes and blinds opponents. Anyone in the cone must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude 
save or take a -2 penalty on all attack and damage rolls until 1d6 minutes after 
leaving the cone. The cone lasts 1 round, and the nightmare uses it once as a free 
action during its turn each round. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Because of the smoke it gives off, a nightmare has concealment against creatures 
5 feet away and total concealment against creatures 10 feet or farther away. The 
smoke does not obscure the nightmare's vision at all.

\textbf{Astral Projection and Etherealness (Su):} These abilities function just 
like the spells of the same names (caster level 20th); a nightmare can use either 
at will.

\textbf{Carrying Capacity: }A light load for a nightmare is up to 300 pounds; a 
medium load, 301-600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601-900 pounds.

\vspace{12pt}
CAUCHEMAR

The cauchemar is a horrible, especially malevolent version of a nightmare. The 
sight of one of these great horrors bearing down is enough to shake the heart of 
the boldest champion.

COMBAT

The save DC for the cauchemar's smoke attack (DC 24) is adjusted for its greater 
number of Hit Dice and higher Constitution score.

Carrying Capacity: A light load for a cauchemar is up to 612 pounds; a medium load, 
613-1,224 pounds; and a heavy load, 1,225-1,840 pounds.

\vspace{12pt}
{\LARGE{}NIGHTSHADE}

Nightshades are powerful undead composed of equal parts darkness and absolute evil.

Nightshades can read and understand all forms of communication; however, they communicate 
with others by telepathy.

COMBAT

Each of the three known varieties of nightshade is a terrible creature with unique 
powers and abilities. Their tactics vary according to their abilities, but they 
all make liberal use of \textit{haste}.

\vspace{12pt}
Nightshade Abilities

All nightshades have the following special abilities.

\textbf{Aversion to Daylight (Ex): }If exposed to natural daylight (not merely 
a \textit{daylight }spell), nightshades take a -4 penalty on all attack rolls, 
saving throws, and skill checks.

\textbf{Desecrating Aura (Su):} All nightshades give off a 20-footradius emanation 
of utter desecration, imbuing their surroundings with negative energy. This ability 
works much like a \textit{desecrate }spell, except that the nightshade's evil is 
so great that it is treated as the shrine of an evil power. All undead within 20 
feet of the nightshade (including the creature itself ) gain a +2 profane bonus 
on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws, and +2 hit points per HD. (The 
nightshade Hit Dice, attack, and save entries given here include these profane 
bonuses.) Charisma checks made to turn undead within this area take a -6 penalty.

A nightshade's desecrating aura cannot be dispelled except by a \textit{dispel 
evil }spell or similar effect. If the effect is dispelled, the nightshade can resume 
it as a free action on its next turn. Its desecrating aura is suppressed if a nightshade 
enters a \textit{consecrated }or \textit{hallowed }area, but the nightshade's presence 
also suppresses the \textit{consecrated }or \textit{hallowed }effect for as long 
as it remains in the area.

A nightcrawler is a massive behemoth similar to a purple worm, though utterly black 
in color.

A nightcrawler measures about 7 feet in diameter and is 100 feet long from its 
toothy maw to the tip of its stinging tail. It weighs about 55,000 pounds.

Combat

A nightcrawler attacks by burrowing through the ground and emerging to strike.

A nightcrawler's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of 
overcoming damage reduction.

\textbf{Energy Drain (Su):} Living creatures inside a nightcrawler's gizzard gain 
one negative level each round. The DC is 26 for the Fortitude save to remove a 
negative level. The save DC is Charisma-based.

For each such negative level bestowed, the nightcrawler gains 5 temporary hit points. 

\textbf{Improved Grab (Ex):} To use this ability, a nightcrawler must hit with 
its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without 
provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes 
a hold and can try to swallow the opponent in the following round.

\textbf{Poison (Ex):} Injury, Fortitude DC 22, initial and secondary damage 2d6 
Str. The save DC is Constitution-based.

\textbf{Spell-Like Abilities: }At will---\textit{contagion }(DC 18), \textit{deeper 
darkness, detect magic, greater dispel magic, haste, invisibility, see invisibility, 
unholy blight }(DC 18); 3/day---\textit{cone of cold }(DC 19), \textit{confusion 
}(DC 18), \textit{hold monster }(DC 19); 1/day---\textit{finger of death }(DC 21), 
\textit{mass hold monster }(DC 23), \textit{plane shift }(DC 21). Caster level 
25th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

\textbf{Summon Undead (Su):} A nightcrawler can summon undead creatures once per 
night: 9-16 shadows, 3-6 greater shadows, or 2-4 dread wraiths. The undead arrive 
in 1d10 rounds and serve for 1 hour or until released.

\textbf{Swallow Whole (Ex):} A nightcrawler can try to swallow a grabbed opponent 
of Huge or smaller size by making a successful grapple check. Once inside, the 
opponent takes 2d8+12 points of bludgeoning damage plus 12 points of acid damage 
per round from the nightcrawler's gizzard and is subject to the creature's energy 
drain. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing 
weapon to deal 35 points of damage to the gizzard (AC 21). Once the creature exits, 
muscular action closes the hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its own way 
out. A nightcrawler's interior can hold 2 Huge, 8 Large, 32 Medium, 128 Small, 
512 Tiny or smaller opponents.

Nightwalkers are human-shaped horrors that haunt the darkness.

A nightwalker is about 20 feet tall and weighs about 12,000 pounds.

Combat

Nightwalkers lurk in dark areas where they can almost always surprise the unwary.

A nightwalker's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of 
overcoming damage reduction.

\textbf{Crush Item (Su):} A nightwalker can destroy any weapon or item of Large 
size or smaller (even magic ones, but not artifacts) by picking it up and crushing 
it between its hands. The nightwalker must make a successful disarm attempt to 
grab an item held by an opponent. The item is entitled to a DC 34 Fortitude save 
to resist destruction. The save DC is Strength-based. 

\textbf{Evil Gaze (Su):} Fear, 30 feet. A creature that meets the nightwalker's 
gaze must succeed on a DC 24 Will save or be paralyzed with fear for 1d8 rounds. 
Whether or not the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by 
the same nightshade's gaze for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. 
The save DC is Charisma-based.

\textbf{Spell-Like Abilities:} At will---\textit{contagion }(DC 18), \textit{deeper 
darkness, detect magic, greater dispel magic, haste, see invisibility, }and \textit{unholy 
blight }(DC 18); 3/day---\textit{confusion }(DC 18), \textit{hold monster }(DC 
19), \textit{invisibility; }1/day---\textit{cone of cold }(DC 19), \textit{finger 
of death }(DC 21), \textit{plane shift }(DC 21). Caster level 21st. The save DCs 
are Charisma-based.

\textbf{Summon Undead (Su):} A nightwalker can summon undead creatures once per 
night: 7-12 shadows, 2-5 greater shadows, or 1-2 dread wraiths. The undead arrive 
in 1d10 rounds and serve for 1 hour or until released.

\textbf{Skills:} *When hiding in a dark area, a nightwalker gains a +8 racial bonus 
on Hide checks.

Tactics Round-by-Round

The nightwalker is an exceedingly intelligent foe that makes the best use of all 
its abilities. It favors using its spell-like abilities to divide and disable its 
enemies, then closing to melee with opponents it has isolated from their allies.

\textit{Prior to combat: }The nightwalker keeps its \textit{see invisibility }power 
active most of the time. It uses \textit{haste }and \textit{invisibility }to prepare 
for battle.

\textit{Round 1: }Move to within 30 feet to make use of gaze attack and strike 
with \textit{confusion }or \textit{hold monster, }coupled with a quickened \textit{unholy 
blight.}

\textit{Round 2: }Hit a spellcaster with \textit{finger of death }and another quickened 
\textit{unholy blight.}

\textit{Round 3: }Move up to engage the enemy and attempt to disarm an enemy fighter.

\textit{Round 4: }Crush the disarmed weapon (or use gaze attack if disarm attempt 
failed).

\textit{Round 5: }Full attack against the unarmed foe (or on a nearby spellcaster).

Nightwings are batlike flyers that hunt on the wing.

A nightwing has a wingspan of about 40 feet and weighs about 4,000 pounds.

Combat

Nightwings prowl the night sky and dive onto their victims. They are all but invisible, 
detectable only because of the stars they obscure in their passing.

A nightwing's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming 
damage reduction.

\textbf{Magic Drain (Su):} A nightwing can weaken magic armor, weapons, and shields 
by making a successful touch attack. The targeted item must succeed on a DC 22 
Fortitude save or lose 1 point of its enhancement bonus. The save DC is Charisma-based. 
An item that loses its entire enhancement bonus becomes merely a masterwork item 
and loses any special abilities (such as flaming) as well. Casting \textit{dispel 
evil }upon the item reverses the effect of the magic drain, provided this occurs 
within a number of days after the attack equal to the caster's level and the caster 
succeeds on a DC 29 caster level check.

A nymph is about the height and weight of a female elf.

Nymphs speak Sylvan and Common.

COMBAT

\textbf{Blinding Beauty (Su): }This ability affects all humanoids within 30 feet 
of a nymph. Those who look directly at a nymph must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude 
save or be blinded permanently as though by the \textit{blindness }spell. A nymph 
can suppress or resume this ability as a free action.

The save DC is Charisma-based.

\textbf{Spell-Like Abilities:} 1/day---\textit{dimension door. }Caster level 7th.

\textbf{Spells:} A nymph casts divine spells as a 7th-level druid.

\textit{Typical Druid Spells Prepared }(6/5/4/3/1, save DC 13 + spell level): 0---\textit{cure 
minor wounds, detect magic, flare, guidance, light, resistance; }1st---\textit{calm 
animal, cure light wounds, entangle, longstrider, speak with animals; }2nd---\textit{barkskin, 
heat metal, lesser restoration, tree shape; }3rd--- \textit{call lightning, cure 
moderate wounds, protection from energy; }4th---\textit{rusting grasp.}

\textbf{Stunning Glance (Su): }As a standard action, a wrathful nymph can stun 
a creature within 30 feet with a look. The target creature must succeed on a DC 
17 Fortitude save or be stunned for 2d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.

\textbf{Unearthly Grace (Su):} A nymph adds her Charisma modifier as a bonus on 
all her saving throws, and as a deflection bonus to her Armor Class. (The statistics 
block already reflects these bonuses).

\textbf{Wild Empathy (Ex):} This power works like the druid's wild empathy class 
feature, except that a nymph has a +6 racial bonus on the check.

\textbf{Skills:} A nymph has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some 
special action or avoid a hazard. She can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, 
even if distracted or endangered. She can use the run action while swimming, provided 
she swims in a straight line.
