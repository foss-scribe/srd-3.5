Adult ogres stand 9 to 10 feet tall and weigh 600 to 650 pounds. Their skin color 
ranges from dull yellow to dull brown. Their clothing consists of poorly cured 
furs and hides, which add to their naturally repellent odor.

Ogres speak Giant, and those specimens who boast Intelligence scores of at least 
10 also speak Common.

COMBAT

Ogres favor overwhelming odds, sneak attacks, and ambushes over a fair fight. They 
are intelligent enough to fire ranged weapons first to soften up their foes before 
closing, but ogre gangs and bands fight as unorganized individuals.

\vspace{12pt}
OGRE BARBARIAN

Their inherent bent toward chaos combines with their size and strength to make 
ogres natural barbarians. Indeed, their leaders are almost always barbarians of 
low to middle level, monstrous brutes whose fury in battle is truly fearsome. A 
raging ogre barbarian is an inspiration to other ogres.

COMBAT

Marginally more intelligent than his brutish fellows, an ogre barbarian is slightly 
more likely to enter a fair fight, but in general prefers the brutish tactics common 
to all its kind.

\textbf{Rage (Ex): }Twice per day, an ogre barbarian can enter a state of fierce 
rage that last for 9 rounds. The following changes are in effect as long as he 
rages: AC 17 (touch 8, flat-footed 17); hp 95; Atk +18/+13 melee (2d6+16, \textit{+1 
greatclub}); SV Fort +14, Will +4; Str 30, Con 22; Climb +15, Jump +16. At the 
end of his rage, the ogre barbarian is fatigued for the duration of the encounter.

\textbf{Trap Sense (Ex):} An ogre barbarian has a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made 
to avoid traps. He also has a +1 bonus to his AC against attacks by traps.

\textbf{Uncanny Dodge (Ex): }An ogre barbarian retains his Dex bonus to AC regardless 
of being caught flat-footed or attacked by an invisible opponent. His Dex bonus 
to AC is +0, but this means that he is not subject to a rogue's sneak attack in 
these circumstances.

\vspace{12pt}
MERROW

These cousins of the ogre have the aquatic subtype.

They dwell in freshwater lakes and rivers. They have a base land speed of 30 feet 
and a swim speed of 40 feet and are found only in aquatic environments.

Instead of the typical ogre's greatclub, they prefer to use longspears in melee 
(attack +8 melee, damage 1d8+7).

The ogre mage is a more intelligent and dangerous variety of its mundane cousin.

An ogre mage stands about 10 feet tall and weighs up to 700 pounds. Its skin varies 
in color from light green to light blue, and its hair is black or very dark brown. 
Ogre mages favor loose, comfortable clothing and lightweight armor.

Ogre mages speak Giant and Common.

Combat

Ogre mages rely on their spell-like abilities, resorting to physical combat only 
when necessary. When faced with obviously superior forces, they prefer to retreat 
using \textit{gaseous form }rather than fight a losing battle.

\textbf{Spell-Like Abilities:} At will---\textit{darkness, invisibility; }1/day--- 
\textit{charm person }(DC 14)\textit{, cone of cold }(DC 18)\textit{, gaseous form, 
polymorph, sleep }(DC 14)\textit{. }Caster level 9th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

\textbf{Flight (Su):} An ogre mage can cease or resume flight as a free action. 
While using \textit{gaseous form }it can fly at its normal speed and has perfect 
maneuverability.

\textbf{Regeneration (Ex):} Fire and acid deal normal damage to an ogre mage.

An ogre mage that loses a limb or body part can reattach it by holding the severed 
member to the stump. Reattachment takes 1 minute. If the head or some other vital 
organ is severed, it must be reattached within 10 minutes or the creature dies. 
An ogre mage cannot regrow lost body parts.

{\LARGE{}OOZE}

Oozes are amorphous creatures that live only to eat. They inhabit underground areas 
throughout the world, scouring caverns, ruins, and dungeons in search of organic 
matter---living or dead.

COMBAT

Oozes attack any creatures they encounter. They lash out with pseudopods or simply 
engulf opponents with their bodies, which secrete acids that help them catch or 
digest their prey.

\textbf{Blindsight (Ex): }An ooze's entire body is a primitive sensory organ that 
can ascertain prey by scent and vibration within 60 feet.

\vspace{12pt}
The typical black pudding measures 15 feet across and 2 feet thick. It weighs about 
18,000 pounds.

Combat

A black pudding attacks by grabbing and squeezing their prey.

\textbf{Acid (Ex):} The creature secretes a digestive acid that dissolves organic 
material and metal quickly, but does not affect stone. Any melee hit or constrict 
attack deals acid damage, and the opponent's armor and clothing dissolve and become 
useless immediately unless they succeed on DC 21 Reflex saves. A metal or wooden 
weapon that strikes a black pudding also dissolves immediately unless it succeeds 
on a DC 21 Reflex save. The save DCs are Constitution-based.

The pudding's acidic touch deals 21 points of damage per round to wooden or metal 
objects, but the ooze must remain in contact with the object for 1 full round to 
deal this damage.

\textbf{Constrict (Ex): }A black pudding deals automatic slam and acid damage with 
a successful grapple check. The opponent's clothing and armor take a -4 penalty 
on Reflex saves against the acid.

\textbf{Improved Grab (Ex): }To use this ability, a black pudding must hit with 
its slam attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without 
provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes 
a hold and can constrict.

\textbf{Split (Ex): }Slashing and piercing weapons deal no damage to a black pudding. 
Instead the creature splits into two identical puddings, each with half of the 
original's current hit points (round down). A pudding with 10 hit points or less 
cannot be further split and dies if reduced to 0 hit points.

\textbf{Skills:} A black pudding has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can 
always choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or threatened.

\vspace{12pt}
ELDER BLACK PUDDING

The most ancient black puddings are vast pools of inky death.

COMBAT

The save DC for the elder black pudding's acid attack (DC 29) is adjusted for its 
additional Hit Dice and higher Constitution score.

The nearly transparent gelatinous cube travels slowly along dungeon corridors and 
cave floors, absorbing carrion, creatures, and trash. Inorganic material remains 
trapped and visible inside the cube's body.

A typical gelatinous cube is 15 feet on a side and weighs about 50,000 pounds, 
though much larger specimens are not unknown.

Combat

A gelatinous cube attacks by slamming its body into its prey. It is capable of 
lashing out with a pseudopod, but usually engulfs foes.

\textbf{Acid (Ex):} A gelatinous cube's acid does not harm metal or stone.

\textbf{Engulf (Ex):} Although it moves slowly, a gelatinous cube can simply mow 
down Large or smaller creatures as a standard action. It cannot make a slam attack 
during a round in which it engulfs. The gelatinous cube merely has to move over 
the opponents, affecting as many as it can cover. Opponents can make opportunity 
attacks against the cube, but if they do so they are not entitled to a saving throw. 
Those who do not attempt attacks of opportunity must succeed on a DC 13 Reflex 
save or be engulfed; on a success, they are pushed back or aside (opponent's choice) 
as the cube moves forward. Engulfed creatures are subject to the cube's paralysis 
and acid, and are considered to be grappled and trapped within its body. The save 
DC is Strength-based and includes a +1 racial bonus.

\textbf{Paralysis (Ex): }A gelatinous cube secretes an anesthetizing slime. A target 
hit by a cube's melee or engulf attack must succeed on a DC 20 Fortitude save or 
be paralyzed for 3d6 rounds. The cube can automatically engulf a paralyzed opponent. 
The save DC is Constitution-based.

\textbf{Transparent (Ex):} Gelatinous cubes are hard to see, even under ideal conditions, 
and it takes a DC 15 Spot check to notice one. Creatures who fail to notice a cube 
and walk into it are automatically engulfed.

A gray ooze can grow to a diameter of up to 10 feet and a thickness of about 6 
inches. A typical specimen weighs about 700 pounds.

Combat

A gray ooze strikes like a snake, slamming opponents with its body.

\textbf{Acid (Ex): }A gray ooze secretes a digestive acid that quickly dissolves 
organic material and metal, but not stone. Any melee hit or constrict attack deals 
acid damage. Armor or clothing dissolves and becomes useless immediately unless 
it succeeds on a DC 16 Reflex save. A metal or wooden weapon that strikes a gray 
ooze also dissolves immediately unless it succeeds on a DC 16 Reflex save. The 
save DCs are Constitution-based.

The ooze's acidic touch deals 16 points of damage per round to wooden or metal 
objects, but the ooze must remain in contact with the object for 1 full round to 
deal this damage.

\textbf{Constrict (Ex):} A gray ooze deals automatic slam and acid damage with 
a successful grapple check. The opponent's clothing and armor take a -4 penalty 
on Reflex saves against the acid.

\textbf{Improved Grab (Ex): }To use this ability, a gray ooze must hit with its 
slam attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking 
an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and 
can constrict. 

\textbf{Transparent (Ex):} A gray ooze is hard to identify, even under ideal conditions, 
and it takes a DC 15 Spot check to notice one. Creatures who fail to notice a gray 
ooze and walk into it are automatically hit with a melee attack for slam and acid 
damage.

An ochre jelly can grow to a diameter of about 15 feet and a thickness of about 
6 inches, but can compress its body to fit into cracks as small as 1 inch wide. 
A typical specimen weighs about 5,600 pounds.

Combat

An ochre jelly attempts to envelop and squeeze its prey.

\textbf{Acid (Ex):} An ochre jelly secretes a digestive acid that dissolves only 
flesh. Any melee hit or constrict attack deals acid damage.

\textbf{Constrict (Ex): }An ochre jelly deals automatic slam and acid damage with 
a successful grapple check.

\textbf{Improved Grab (Ex): }To use this ability, an ochre jelly must hit with 
its slam attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without 
provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes 
a hold and can constrict.

\textbf{Split (Ex):} Slashing and piercing weapons and electricity attacks deal 
no damage to an ochre jelly. Instead the creature splits into two identical jellies, 
each with half of the original's current hit points (round down). A jelly with 
10 hit points or less cannot be further split and dies if reduced to 0 it points.

\textbf{Skills:} An ochre jelly has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always 
choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or threatened.

An orc's hair usually is black. It has lupine ears and reddish eyes. Orcs prefer 
wearing vivid colors that many humans would consider unpleasant, such as blood 
red, mustard yellow, yellow-green, and deep purple. Their equipment is dirty and 
unkempt. An adult male orc is a little over 6 feet tall and weighs about 210 pounds.

Females are slightly smaller.

The language an orc speaks varies slightly from tribe to tribe, but any orc is 
understandable by someone else who speaks Orc. Some orcs know Goblin or Giant as 
well.

Most orcs encountered away from their homes are warriors; the information in the 
statistics block is for one of 1st level.

COMBAT

Orcs are proficient with all simple weapons, preferring those that cause the most 
damage in the least time. Many orcs who take up the warrior or fighter class also 
gain proficiency with the falchion or the greataxe as a martial weapon. They enjoy 
attacking from concealment and setting ambushes, and they obey the rules of war 
(such as honoring a truce) only as long as it is convenient for them.

\textbf{Light Sensitivity (Ex):} Orcs are dazzled in bright sunlight or within 
the radius of a \textit{daylight }spell.

The orc warrior presented here had the following ability scores before racial adjustments: 
Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8.

HALF-ORCS

These orc-human crossbreeds can be found in either orc or human society (where 
their status varies according to local sentiments), or in communities of their 
own. Half-orcs usually inherit a good blend of the physical characteristics of 
their parents. They are as tall as humans and a little heavier, thanks to their 
muscle. They have greenish pigmentation, sloping foreheads, jutting jaws, prominent 
teeth, and coarse body hair. Half-orcs who have lived among or near orcs have scars, 
in keeping with orcish tradition.

A typical otyugh has a body 8 feet in diameter and weighs about 500 pounds.

Otyughs speak Common.

COMBAT

it is content to remain hidden. Otyughs slash and squeeze opponents with their 
tentacles, which they also use to drag prey into their mouths.

\textbf{Constrict (Ex):} An otyugh deals automatic tentacle damage with a successful 
grapple check.

days; damage 1d3 Dex and 1d3 Con. The save DC is Constitution-based.

\textbf{Improved Grab (Ex):} To use this ability, an otyugh must hit with a tentacle 
attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking 
an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and 
can constrict.

\textbf{Skills: }*An otyugh has a +8 racial bonus on Hide checks when in its lair, 
due to its natural coloration.

Giant owls are nocturnal birds of prey, feared for their ability to hunt and attack 
in near silence. They are intelligent, and though naturally suspicious, sometimes 
associate with good creatures.  A typical giant owl stands about 9 feet tall, has 
a wingspan of up to 20 feet, and resembles its smaller cousins in nearly every 
way except size.

Giant owls speak Common and Sylvan.

COMBAT

A giant owl attacks by gliding silently just a few feet above its prey and plunging 
to strike when directly overhead.

\textbf{Superior Low-Light Vision (Ex):} A giant owl can see five times as far 
as a human can in dim light.

\textbf{Skills:} Giant owls have a +8 racial bonus on Listen checks and a +4 racial 
bonus on Spot checks.

*When in flight, giant owls gain a +8 bonus on Move Silently checks.

TRAINING A GIANT OWL

Although intelligent, a giant owl requires training before it can bear a rider 
in combat. To be trained, a giant owl must have a friendly attitude toward the 
trainer (this can be achieved through a successful Diplomacy check). Training a 
friendly giant owl requires six weeks of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check. 
Riding a giant owl requires an exotic saddle. A giant owl can fight while carrying 
a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check.

Giant owl eggs are worth 2,500 gp apiece on the open market, while chicks are worth 
4,000 gp each. Professional trainers charge 1,000 gp to rear or train a giant owl.

\textbf{Carrying Capacity:} A light load for a giant owl is up to 300 pounds; a 
medium load, 301-600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601-900 pounds.

An owlbear's coat ranges in color from brown-black to yellowish brown; its beak 
is a dull ivory color. A full-grown male can stand as tall as 8 feet and weigh 
up to 1,500 pounds. Adventurers who have survived encounters with the creature 
often speak of the bestial madness they glimpsed in its red-rimmed eyes.

COMBAT

Owlbears attack prey---any creature bigger than a mouse---on sight, always fighting 
to the death. They slash with claws and beak, trying to grab their prey and rip 
it apart. 

\textbf{Improved Grab (Ex):} To use this ability, an owlbear must hit with a claw 
attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking 
an attack of opportunity.

The pegasus is a magnificent winged horse that sometimes serves the cause of good. 
Though highly prized as aerial steeds, pegasi are wild and shy creatures not easily 
tamed.

A typical pegasus stands 6 feet high at the shoulder, weighs 1,500 pounds, and 
has a wingspan of 20 feet. Pegasi cannot speak, but they understand Common.

COMBAT

\textbf{Spell-Like Abilities:} At will---\textit{detect good }and \textit{detect 
evil }within a 60-foot radius. Caster level 5th.

\textbf{Skills:} Pegasi have a +4 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.

TRAINING A PEGASUS

Although intelligent, a pegasus requires training before it can bear a rider in 
combat. To be trained, a pegasus must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer 
(this can be achieved through a successful Diplomacy check). Training a friendly 
pegasus requires six weeks of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check. Riding a pegasus 
requires an exotic saddle. A pegasus can fight while carrying a rider, but the 
rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check.

Pegasus eggs are worth 2,000 gp each on the open market, while young are worth 
3,000 gp per head. Pegasi mature at the same rate as horses. Professional trainers 
charge 1,000 gp to rear or train a pegasus, which serves a good or neutral master 
with absolute faithfulness for life.

\textbf{Carrying Capacity:} A light load for a pegasus is up to 300 pounds; a medium 
load, 301-600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601-900 pounds.

This creature looks like a brown and greenish-brown mass with a cluster of nodules 
atop the main mass, though it is visible only when dead. A cluster of nodules atop 
the main mass serve as sensory organs. The creature feeds and attacks with a gaping 
maw lined with rows of teeth. Four stumpy legs support the creature and allow it 
to move about. This ambulatory fungus is naturally invisible, making it a feared 
predator among subterranean inhabitants.

COMBAT

A phantom fungus usually roams quietly, hunting for prey. It attacks lone individuals 
almost anywhere, but when tackling groups it prefers an open space where it has 
a better chance .

\textbf{Greater Invisibility (Su):} This ability is constant, allowing a phantom 
fungus to remain invisible even when attacking. It works like \textit{greater invisibility 
}(caster level 12th) and lasts as long as the phantom fungus is alive. This ability 
is not subject to the \textit{invisibility purge }spell. A phantom fungus becomes 
visible 1 minute after it is killed.

\textbf{Skills:} A phantom fungus has a +5 racial bonus on Move Silently checks.

Phase spiders are aggressive predators that can move quickly from the Ethereal 
Plane to attack opponents on the Material Plane.

A typical phase spider's body is 8 feet long. It weighs about 700 pounds.

Phase spiders cannot speak.

COMBAT

Phase spiders dwell and hunt on the Material Plane. Once a spider locates prey, 
however, it shifts to the Ethereal Plane to attack, attempting to catch its victim 
flat-footed. The spider shifts in, bites its victim, and retreats quickly back 
to the Ethereal Plane.

\textbf{Ethereal Jaunt (Su): }A phase spider can shift from the Ethereal Plane 
to the Material Plane as a free action, and shift back again as a move action (or 
during a move action). The ability is otherwise identical with \textit{ethereal 
jaunt }(caster level 15th). 

\textbf{Poison (Ex): }Injury, Fortitude DC 17, initial and secondary damage 1d8 
Con. The save DC is Constitution-based.

\textbf{Skills:} A phase spider has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always 
choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or threatened.

A phasm is an amorphous creature that can assume the guise of almost any other 
creature or object. A phasm in its natural form is about 5 feet in diameter and 
2 feet high at the center. Swirls of color indicate sensory organs. In this form, 
a phasm slithers about like an ooze and can attack with a pseudopod. It weighs 
about 400 pounds.

Phasms can speak Common but prefer telepathic communication.

COMBAT

When faced with potential danger, a phasm is equally likely to retreat, parley, 
or attack, as its fancy strikes. 

If pursued or harassed, a phasm transforms into the most fearsome creature it knows 
and attacks. When seriously hurt, it changes to some fast or agile form and tries 
to escape.

\textbf{Amorphous (Ex): }A phasm in its natural form has immunity to poison, \textit{sleep, 
}paralysis, polymorph, and stunning effects. It is not subject to critical hits 
and, having no clear front or back, cannot be flanked.

\textbf{Resilient (Ex): }A phasm has a +4 racial bonus on Fortitude and Reflex 
saves (included in the statistics block).

Alternate Form (Su): A phasm can assume any form of Large size or smaller as a 
standard action. This ability functions as a \textit{polymorph }spell cast on itself 
(caster level 15th), except that the phasm does not regain hit points for changing 
form. A phasm can remain in its alternate form until it chooses to assume a new 
one or return to its natural form.

\textbf{Tremorsense (Ex):} A phasm can automatically sense the location of anything 
within 60 feet that is in contact with the ground, so long as it is touching the 
ground itself.

\textbf{Skills:} *When using shapechange, a phasm gains a +10 circumstance bonus 
on Disguise checks.

\subsection*{{\LARGE{}PLANETOUCHED}}

Planetouched is a general word to describe someone who can trace his or her bloodline 
back to an outsider, usually a fiend or celestial.

The effects of having a supernatural being in one's heritage last for many generations. 
Although not as dramatically altered as a half-celestial or a half-fiend, planetouched 
still retain some special qualities.

The two planetouched varieties described here are the most common. Aasimars are 
humans with some trace of celestial blood in their veins, and tieflings have some 
fiendishness in their family tree.

Aasimars are usually tall, good-looking, and generally pleasant. Some have a minor 
physical trait suggesting their heritage, such as silver hair, golden eyes, or 
an unnaturally intense stare.

Most aasimars are decidedly good-aligned. They fight against evil causes and attempt 
to sway others to do the right thing. Occasionally they take on the vengeful, judgmental 
aspect of their celestial ancestor, but this is rare. Combat

Aasimars usually like a fair, straightforward contest. Against a particularly evil 
foe, however, they fight with utter conviction and to the death.

\textit{\textbf{Daylight }}\textbf{(Sp):} An aasimar can use day\textit{light }once 
per day as a 1\textsuperscript{st}-level caster or a caster of his class levels, 
whichever is higher.

\textbf{Skills:} An aasimar has a +2 racial bonus on Spot and Listen checks.

Many tieflings are indistinguishable from humans. Others have small horns, pointed 
teeth, red eyes, a whiff of brimstone about them, or even cloven feet. No two tieflings 
are the same. 

Combat

Tieflings are sneaky, subtle, and generally conniving. They prefer to strike from 
ambush and usually avoid a fair fight if they can.

\textit{\textbf{Darkness }}\textbf{(Sp): }A tiefling can use \textit{darkness }once 
per day (caster level equal to class levels).

\textbf{Skills:} A tiefling has a +2 racial bonus on Bluff and Hide checks.

A pseudodragon has a body about 1 foot long, with a 2-foot tail. It weights about 
7 pounds.

A pseudodragon can communicate telepathically and can also vocalize animal noises.

COMBAT

A pseudodragon can deliver a vicious bite, but its principal weapon is its sting-equipped 
tail.

\textbf{Poison (Ex): }Injury, Fortitude DC 14, initial damage sleep for 1 minute, 
secondary damage sleep for 1d3 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes 
a +2 racial bonus.

The body of a mature purple worm is 5 feet in diameter and 80 feet long, weighing 
about 40,000 pounds. The creature has a poisonous stinger in its tail.

COMBAT

In battle, a purple worm forms into a coil 20 feet in diameter, biting and stinging 
anything within reach.

\textbf{Improved Grab (Ex): }To use this ability, a purple worm must hit with its 
bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking 
an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and 
can attempt to swallow the foe the following round.

\textbf{Poison (Ex): }Injury, Fortitude DC 25, initial damage 1d6 Str, secondary 
damage 2d6 Str. The save DC is Constitution-based.

\textbf{Swallow Whole (Ex):} A purple worm can try to swallow a grabbed opponent 
of a smaller size than itself by making a successful grapple check. Once inside, 
the opponent takes 2d8+12 points of crushing damage plus 8 points of acid damage 
per round from the worm's gizzard. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by 
using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 25 points of damage to the gizzard 
(AC 17). Once the creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; another swallowed 
opponent must cut its own way out. A Gargantuan worm's interior can hold 2 Large, 
8 Medium, 32 Small, 128 Tiny, or 512 Diminutive or smaller opponents.

\textbf{Skills:} A purple worm has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform 
some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim 
check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, 
provided it swims in a straight line.

A closer look at a rakshasa reveals that the palms of its hands are where the backs 
of the hands would be on a human.

A rakshasa is about the same height and weight as a human.

Rakshasas speak Common, Infernal, and Undercommon.

COMBAT

In close combat, which a rakshasa disdains as ignoble, it employs its sharp claws 
and powerful bite. Whenever possible, it uses its other abilities to make such 
encounters unnecessary.

\textbf{Detect Thoughts (Su): }A rakshasa can continuously use detect thoughts 
as the spell (caster level 18th; Will DC 15 negates). It can suppress or resume 
this ability as a free action. The save DC is Charisma-based.

\textbf{Spells:} A rakshasa casts spells as a 7th-level sorcerer. 

\textit{Typical Sorcerer Spells Known }(6/7/7/5; save DC 13 + spell level): 0---\textit{detect 
magic, light, mage hand, message, read magic, resistance, touch of fatigue; }1st---\textit{charm 
person, mage armor, magic missile, shield, silent image; }2nd---\textit{bear's 
endurance, invisibility, acid arrow; }3rd---\textit{haste, suggestion.}

\textbf{Change Shape (Su):} A rakshasa can assume any humanoid form, or revert 
to its own form, as a standard action. In humanoid form, a rakshasa loses its claw 
and bite attacks (although it often equips itself with weapons and armor instead). 
A rakshasa remains in one form until it chooses to assume a new one. A change in 
form cannot be dispelled, but the rakshasa reverts to its natural form when killed. 
A \textit{true seeing }spell reveals its natural form.

\textbf{Skills:} A rakshasa has a +4 racial bonus on Bluff and Disguise checks. 
*When using change shape, a rakshasa gains an additional +10 circumstance bonus 
on Disguise checks. If reading an opponent's mind, its circumstance bonus on Bluff 
and Disguise checks increases by a further +4.

RAKSHASAS AS CHARACTERS

7d8 Hit Dice, a base attack bonus of +7, and base saving throw bonuses of Fort 
+5, Ref +5, and Will +5.---

Racial Skills: A rakshasa's outsider levels give it skill points equal to 10 x 
(8 + Int modifier). Its class skills are Bluff, Disguise, Listen, Move Silently, 
Perform, Sense Motive, and Spot. A rakshasa has a +4 racial bonus on Bluff and 
Disguise checks, and it can gain further bonuses by using change shape (+10 on 
Disguise checks) and detect thoughts (+4 on Bluff and Disguise checks).---

takes additional levels of sorcerer, these levels stack with the rakshasa's base 
spellcasting ability for spells known, spells per day, and other effects dependent 
on caster level. A rakshasa character likewise uses the sum of its

racial spellcasting levels and class levels to determine the abilities

of its familiar.---

A rast has anywhere from ten to fifteen claws, though it can only use four at once.

A rast has a body about the size of a large dog's, with a head almost as large 
as the body. It weighs about 200 pounds.

COMBAT

Rasts paralyze as many of their foes as possible, then attack any that are still 
moving. A rast can claw or bite, but cannot do both during the same round.

\textbf{Paralyzing Gaze (Su):} Paralysis for 1d6 rounds, 30 feet, Fortitude DC 
13 negates. The save DC is Charisma-based.

\textbf{Improved Grab (Ex): }To use this ability, a rast must hit with its bite 
attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking 
an attack of opportunity.

\textbf{Blood Drain (Ex): }A rast drains blood from a grabbed opponent, dealing 
1 point of Constitution damage each round it maintains the hold.

\textbf{Flight (Su): }A rast can cease or resume flight as a free action. A rast 
that loses this ability falls and can perform only a single action (either a move 
action or an attack action) each round.

Ravids are creatures from the Positive Energy Plane. These bizarre entities imbue 
creatures with energy by their touch and animate lifeless objects around them. 
Ravids that make their way to the Material Plane wander about aimlessly, followed 
by the objects to which they have given life.

A ravid is about 7 feet long and weighs about 75 pounds.

COMBAT

Ravids fight only in self-defense. A ravid itself is not very powerful but is always 
accompanied by at least one animated object that defends it.

\textbf{Positive Energy Lash (Su): }A ravid can make a touch attack or hit with 
a claw or tail slap attack to infuse a target with positive energy. The energy 
produces an unpleasant tingle in living creatures, and against undead foes (even 
incorporeal ones) it deals 2d10 points of damage.

Animate Objects (Su): Once per round, a random object within 20 feet of a ravid 
animates as though by the spell \textit{animate objects }(caster level 20th). These 
objects defend the ravid to the best of their ability, but the ravid isn't intelligent 
enough to employ elaborate tactics with them.

\textbf{Flight (Su): }A ravid can cease or resume flight as a free action. A rast 
that loses this ability falls and can perform only a single action (either a move 
action or an attack action) each round.

\textbf{Feats:} A ravid has the Multiattack feat even through it does not have 
the requisite three natural weapons.

A remorhaz is whitish-blue in color but pulses with a reddish glow from the heat 
its body produces. The creature is a little more than 20 feet long, with a body 
about 5 feet wide. It weighs about 10,000 pounds.

Remorhazes cannot speak.

COMBAT

Remorhazes hide under the snow and ice until they hear movement above them, then 
attack from below and surprise prey.

\textbf{Improved Grab (Ex): }To use this ability, a remorhaz must hit an opponent 
least one size category smaller than itself with its bite attack. It can then attempt 
to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. 
If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can attempt to swallow 
the opponent the following round.

\textbf{Swallow Whole (Ex): }When a remorhaz begins its turn with a grappled opponent 
in its mouth, it can swallow that opponent with a successful grapple check. Once 
inside, the opponent takes 2d8+12 points of bludgeoning damage plus 8d6 points 
of fire damage per round from the remorhaz's gizzard. A swallowed creature can 
cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 25 points 
of damage to the gizzard (AC 15). Once the creature exits, muscular action closes 
the hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. A Huge remorhaz's 
interior can hold 2 Large, 4 Medium, 8 Small, 32 Tiny, 128 Diminutive, or 512 Fine 
or smaller opponents.

\textbf{Heat (Ex):} An enraged remorhaz generates heat so intense that anything 
touching its body takes 8d6 points of fire damage. Creatures striking a remorhaz 
with natural attacks or unarmed attacks are subject to this damage, but creatures 
striking with melee weapons do not take damage from the remorhaz's heat. This heat 
can melt or char weapons; any weapon that strikes a remorhaz is allowed a DC 18 
Fortitude save to avoid destruction. The save DC is Constitution-based. Skills: 
Remorhazes have a +4 racial bonus on Listen checks.

A roc's plumage is either dark brown or golden from head to tail. These enormous 
creatures are 30 feet long from the beak to the base of the tail, with wingspans 
as wide as 80 feet. A roc weighs about 8,000 pounds.

COMBAT

A roc attacks from the air, swooping earthward to snatch prey in its powerful talons 
and carry it off for itself and its young to devour. A solitary roc is typically 
hunting and will attack any Medium or larger creature that appears edible. A mated 
pair of rocs attack in concert, fighting to the death to defend their nests or 
hatchlings.

\textbf{Skills:} Rocs have a +4 racial bonus on Spot checks.

A roper stands some 9 feet tall and tapers from 3 or 4 feet in diameter at the 
base to 1 foot across at the top. It weighs 2,200 pounds. A roper's coloration 
and temperature change to match the features of the surrounding cave.

Ropers speak Terran and Undercommon.

COMBAT

A roper hunts by standing very still and imitating a bit of rock. This tactic often 
allows it to attack with surprise. When prey comes within reach, it lashes out 
with its strands. In melee, it bites adjacent opponents with its powerful maw.

\textbf{Drag (Ex): }If a roper hits with a strand attack, the strand latches onto 
the opponent's body. This deals no damage but drags the stuck opponent 10 feet 
closer each subsequent round (provoking no attack of opportunity) unless that creature 
breaks free, which requires a DC 23 Escape Artist check or a DC 19 Strength check. 
The check DCs are Strength-based, and the Escape Artist DC includes a +4 racial 
bonus. A roper can draw in a creature within 10 feet of itself and bite with a 
+4 attack bonus in the same round. A strand has 10 hit points and can be attacked 
by making a successful sunder attempt. However, attacking a roper's strand does 
not provoke an attack of opportunity. If the strand is currently attached to a 
target, the roper takes a -4 penalty on its opposed attack roll to resist the sunder 
attempt. Severing a strand deals no damage to a roper.

\textbf{Strands (Ex):} Most encounters with a roper begin when it fires strong, 
sticky strands. The creature can have up to six strands at once, and they can strike 
up to 50 feet away (no range increment). If a strand is severed, the roper can 
extrude a new one on its next turn as a free action. 

\textbf{Weakness (Ex): }A roper's strands can sap an opponent's strength. Anyone 
grabbed by a strand must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save or take 2d8 points of 
Strength damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.

\textbf{Skills:} *Ropers have a +8 racial bonus on Hide checks in stony or icy 
areas.

The hide of these creatures varies in color from a yellowish tan underside to a 
rust-red upper back. A rust monster's prehensile antennae can rust metals on contact.

The typical rust monster measures 5 feet long and 3 feet high, weighing 200 pounds.

COMBAT

A rust monster can scent a metal object from up to 90 feet away. When it detects 
one, it dashes toward the source and attempts to strike it with its antennae. The 
creature is relentless, chasing characters over long distances if they still possess 
intact metal objects but usually ceasing its attacks to devour a freshly rusted 
meal.

The creature targets the largest metal object available, striking first at armor, 
then at shields and smaller items. It prefers ferrous metals (steel or iron) over 
precious metals (such as gold or silver) but will devour the latter if given the 
opportunity. 

\textbf{Rust (Ex):} A rust monster that makes a successful touch attack with its 
antennae causes the target metal to corrode, falling to pieces and becoming useless 
immediately. The touch can destroy up to a 10-foot cube of metal instantly. Magic 
armor and weapons, and other magic items made of metal, must succeed on a DC 17 
Reflex save or be dissolved. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +4 
racial bonus.

A metal weapon that deals damage to a rust monster corrodes immediately. Wooden, 
stone, and other nonmetallic weapons are unaffected.
