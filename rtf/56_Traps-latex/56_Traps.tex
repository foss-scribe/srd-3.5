\section*{{\LARGE{}TRAPS}}

\vspace{12pt}
\textbf{Types of Traps:} A trap can be either mechanical or magic in nature. Mechanical 
traps include pits, arrow traps, falling blocks, water-filled rooms, whirling blades, 
and anything else that depends on a mechanism to operate. A mechanical trap can 
be constructed by a PC through successful use of the Craft (trapmaking) skill (see 
Designing a Trap, below, and the skill description).

Magic traps are further divided into spell traps and magic device traps. Magic 
device traps initiate spell effects when activated, just as wands, rods, rings, 
and other magic items do. Creating a magic device trap requires the Craft Wondrous 
Item feat (see Designing a Trap and the feat description).

Spell traps are simply spells that themselves function as traps\textit{. }Creating 
a spell trap requires the services of a character who can cast the needed spell 
or spells, who is usually either the character creating the trap or an NPC spellcaster 
hired for the purpose.

\vspace{12pt}
MECHANICAL TRAPS

Dungeons are frequently equipped with deadly mechanical (nonmagical) traps. A trap 
typically is defined by its location and triggering conditions, how hard it is 
to spot before it goes off, how much damage it deals, and whether or not the heroes 
receive a saving throw to mitigate its effects. Traps that attack with arrows, 
sweeping blades, and other types of weaponry make normal attack rolls, with a specific 
attack bonus dictated by the trap's design.

Creatures who succeed on a DC 20 Search check detect a simple mechanical trap before 
it is triggered. (A simple trap is a snare, a trap triggered by a tripwire, or 
a large trap such as a pit.)

A character with the trap sense class feature who succeeds on a DC 21 (or higher) 
Search check detects a well-hidden or complex mechanical trap before it is triggered. 
Complex traps are denoted by their triggering mechanisms and involve pressure plates, 
mechanisms linked to doors, changes in weight, disturbances in the air, vibrations, 
and other sorts of unusual triggers.

\vspace{12pt}
MAGIC TRAPS

Many spells can be used to create dangerous traps. Unless the spell or item description 
states otherwise, assume the following to be true.• 

\parindent=3pt
A successful Search check (DC 25 + spell level) made by a rogue (and only a rogue) 
detects a magic trap before it goes off. Other characters have no chance to find 
a magic trap with a Search check.• 

Magic traps permit a saving throw in order to avoid the effect (DC 10 + spell level 
x $ $1.5).• 

\parindent=7pt
Magic traps may be disarmed by a rogue (and only a rogue) with a successful Disable 
Device check (DC 25 + spell level).

ELEMENTS OF A TRAP

All traps---mechanical or magic---have the following elements: trigger, reset, 
Search DC, Disable Device DC, attack bonus (or saving throw or onset delay), damage/effect, 
and Challenge Rating. Some traps may also include optional elements, such as poison 
or a bypass. These characteristics are described below.

\vspace{12pt}
\subsubsection*{\textbf{Trigger}}

A trap's trigger determines how it is sprung.

\textbf{Location:} A location trigger springs a trap when someone stands in a particular 
square.

\textbf{Proximity:} This trigger activates the trap when a creature approaches 
within a certain distance of it. A proximity trigger differs from a location trigger 
in that the creature need not be standing in a particular square. Creatures that 
are flying can spring a trap with a proximity trigger but not one with a location 
trigger. Mechanical proximity triggers are extremely sensitive to the slightest 
change in the air. This makes them useful only in places such as crypts, where 
the air is unusually still.

The proximity trigger used most often for magic device traps is the \textit{alarm 
}spell. Unlike when the spell is cast, an \textit{alarm }spell used as a trigger 
can have an area that's no larger than the area the trap is meant to protect.

Some magic device traps have special proximity triggers that activate only when 
certain kinds of creatures approach. For example, a \textit{detect good }spell 
can serve as a proximity trigger on an evil altar, springing the attached trap 
only when someone of good alignment gets close enough to it.

\textbf{Sound:} This trigger springs a magic trap when it detects any sound. A 
sound trigger functions like an ear and has a +15 bonus on Listen checks. A successful 
Move Silently check, magical \textit{silence, }and other effects that would negate 
hearing defeat it. A trap with a sound trigger requires the casting of \textit{clairaudience 
}during its construction.

\textbf{Visual:} This trigger for magic traps works like an actual eye, springing 
the trap whenever it ``sees'' something. A trap with a visual trigger requires 
the casting of \textit{arcane eye, clairvoyance, }or \textit{true seeing }during 
its construction. Sight range and the Spot bonus conferred on the trap depend on 
the spell chosen, as shown.

\begin{tabular}{|>{\raggedright}p{50pt}|>{\raggedright}p{122pt}|>{\raggedright}p{47pt}|}
\hline
S\textbf{pell} & S\textbf{ight Range} & S\textbf{pot Bonus}\tabularnewline
\hline
a\textit{rcane eye} & Line of sight (unlimited range) & +20\tabularnewline
\hline
c\textit{lairvoyance} & One preselected location & +15\tabularnewline
\hline
t\textit{rue seeing} & Line of sight (up to 120 ft.) & +30\tabularnewline
\hline
\end{tabular}

If you want the trap to ``see'' in the dark, you must either choose the \textit{true 
seeing }option or add \textit{darkvision }to the trap as well. (\textit{Darkvision 
}limits the trap's sight range in the dark to 60 feet.) If invisibility, disguises, 
or illusions can fool the spell being used, they can fool the visual trigger as 
well. 

\textbf{Touch: }A touch trigger, which springs the trap when touched, is one of 
the simplest kinds of trigger to construct. This trigger may be physically attached 
to the part of the mechanism that deals the damage or it may not. You can make 
a magic touch trigger by adding \textit{alarm }to the trap and reducing the area 
of the effect to cover only the trigger spot.

\textbf{Timed:} This trigger periodically springs the trap after a certain duration 
has passed.

\textbf{Spell:} All spell traps have this kind of trigger. The appropriate spell 
descriptions\textit{ }explain the trigger conditions for traps that contain spell 
triggers.

\vspace{12pt}
\subsubsection*{\textbf{Reset}}

A reset element is the set of conditions under which a trap becomes ready to trigger 
again.

\textbf{No Reset: }Short of completely rebuilding the trap, there's no way to trigger 
it more than once. Spell traps have no reset element. 

\textbf{Repair:} To get the trap functioning again, you must repair it. 

\textbf{Manual: }Resetting the trap requires someone to move the parts back into 
place. This is the kind of reset element most mechanical traps have.

\textbf{Automatic:} The trap resets itself, either immediately or after a timed 
interval.

\vspace{12pt}
\subsubsection*{\textbf{Repairing and Resetting Mechanical Traps}}

Repairing a mechanical trap requires a Craft (trapmaking) check against a DC equal 
to the one for building it. The cost for raw materials is one-fifth of the trap's 
original market price. To calculate how long it takes to fix a trap, use the same 
calculations you would for building it, but use the cost of the raw materials required 
for repair in place of the market price.

Resetting a trap usually takes only a minute or so. For a trap with a more difficult 
reset method, you should set the time and labor required.

\vspace{12pt}
\textbf{Bypass (Optional Element)}

If the builder of a trap wants to be able to move past the trap after it is created 
or placed, it's a good idea to build in a bypass mechanism ---something that temporarily 
disarms the trap. Bypass elements are typically used only with mechanical traps; 
spell traps usually have built-in allowances for the caster to bypass them.

\textbf{Lock:} A lock bypass requires a DC 30 Open Lock check to open. 

\textbf{Hidden Switch:} A hidden switch requires a DC 25 Search check to locate.

\textbf{Hidden Lock: }A hidden lock combines the features above, requiring a DC 
25 Search check to locate and a DC 30 Open Lock check to open.

\vspace{12pt}
\textbf{Search and Disable Device DCs}

The builder sets the Search and Disable Device DCs for a mechanical trap. For a 
magic trap, the values depend on the highest-level spell used.

\textbf{Mechanical Trap:} The base DC for both Search and Disable Device checks 
is 20. Raising or lowering either of these DCs affects the base cost (Table: Cost 
Modifiers for Mechanical Traps) and possibly the CR (Table: CR Modifiers for Mechanical 
Traps). 

\textbf{Magic Trap:} The DC for both Search and Disable Device checks is equal 
to 25 + the spell level of the highest-level spell used. Only characters with the 
trap sense class feature can attempt a Search check or a Disable Device check involving 
a magic trap. These DCs do not affect the trap's cost or CR.

\vspace{12pt}
\subsubsection*{\textbf{Attack Bonus/Saving Throw DC}}

A trap usually either makes an attack roll or forces a saving throw to avoid it. 
Occasionally a trap uses both of these options, or neither (see Never Miss).

\textbf{Pits:} These are holes (covered or not) that characters can fall into and 
take damage. A pit needs no attack roll, but a successful Reflex save (DC set by 
the builder) avoids it. Other save-dependent mechanical traps also fall into this 
category.

Pits in dungeons come in three basic varieties: uncovered, covered, and chasms. 
Pits and chasms can be defeated by judicious application of the Climb skill, the 
Jump skill, or various magical means.

Uncovered pits serve mainly to discourage intruders from going a certain way, although 
they cause much grief to characters who stumble into them in the dark, and they 
can greatly complicate a melee taking place nearby.

Covered pits are much more dangerous. They can be detected with a DC 20 Search 
check, but only if the character is taking the time to carefully examine the area 
before walking across it. A character who fails to detect a covered pit is still 
entitled to a DC 20 Reflex save to avoid falling into it. However, if she was running 
or moving recklessly at the time, she gets no saving throw and falls automatically.

Trap coverings can be as simple as piled refuse (straw, leaves, sticks, garbage), 
a large rug, or an actual trapdoor concealed to appear as a normal part of the 
floor. Such a trapdoor usually swings open when enough weight (usually about 50 
to 80 pounds) is placed upon it. Devious trap builders sometimes design trapdoors 
so that they spring back shut after they open. The trapdoor might lock once it's 
back in place, leaving the stranded character well and truly trapped. Opening such 
a trapdoor is just as difficult as opening a regular door (assuming the trapped 
character can reach it), and a DC 13 Strength check is needed to keep a spring-loaded 
door open.

Pit traps often have something nastier than just a hard floor at the bottom. A 
trap designer may put spikes, monsters, or a pool of acid, lava, or even water 
at the bottom. Spikes at the bottom of a pit deal damage as daggers with a +10 
attack bonus and a +1 bonus on damage for every 10 feet of the fall (to a maximum 
bonus on damage of +5). If the pit has multiple spikes, a falling victim is attacked 
by 1d4 of them. This damage is in addition to any damage from the fall itself. 

Monsters sometimes live in pits. Any monster that can fit into the pit might have 
been placed there by the dungeon's designer, or might simply have fallen in and 
not been able to climb back out. 

A secondary trap, mechanical or magical, at the bottom of a pit can be particularly 
deadly. Activated by a falling victim, the secondary trap attacks the already injured 
character when she's least ready for it.

\textbf{Ranged Attack Traps: }These traps fling darts, arrows, spears, or the like 
at whoever activated the trap. The builder sets the attack bonus. A ranged attack 
trap can be configured to simulate the effect of a composite bow with a high strength 
rating which provides the trap with a bonus on damage equal to its strength rating.

\textbf{Melee Attack Traps: }These traps feature such obstacles as sharp blades 
that emerge from walls and stone blocks that fall from ceilings. Once again, the 
builder sets the attack bonus.

\vspace{12pt}
\subsubsection*{\textbf{Damage/Effect}}

The effect of a trap is what happens to those who spring it. Usually this takes 
the form of either damage or a spell effect, but some traps have special effects.

\textbf{Pits:} Falling into a pit deals 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of depth. 

\textbf{Ranged Attack Traps:} These traps deal whatever damage their ammunition 
normally would. If a trap is constructed with a high strength rating, it has a 
corresponding bonus on damage.

\textbf{Melee Attack Traps:} These traps deal the same damage as the melee weapons 
they ``wield.'' In the case of a falling stone block, you can assign any amount 
of bludgeoning damage you like, but remember that whoever resets the trap has to 
lift that stone back into place. 

A melee attack trap can be constructed with a built-in bonus on damage rolls, just 
as if the trap itself had a high Strength score. 

\textbf{Spell Traps:} Spell traps produce the spell's effect\textit{. }Like all 
spells, a spell trap that allows a saving throw has a save DC of 10 + spell level 
+ caster's relevant ability modifier.

\textbf{Magic Device Traps:} These traps produce the effects of any spells included 
in their construction, as described in the appropriate entries\textit{. }If the 
spell in a magic device trap allows a saving throw, its save DC is 10 + spell level 
x $ $1.5. Some spells make attack rolls instead.

\textbf{Special:} Some traps have miscellaneous features that produce special effects, 
such as drowning for a water trap or ability damage for poison. Saving throws and 
damage depend on the poison or are set by the builder, as appropriate.

\vspace{12pt}
\subsubsection*{\textbf{Miscellaneous Trap Features}}

Some traps include optional features that can make them considerably more deadly. 
The most common such features are discussed below.

\textbf{Alchemical Item:} Mechanical traps may incorporate alchemical devices or 
other special substances or items, such as tanglefoot bags, alchemist's fire, thunderstones, 
and the like. Some such items mimic spell effects. If the item mimics a spell effect, 
it increases the CR as shown on Table: CR Modifiers for Mechanical Traps.

\textbf{Gas:} With a gas trap, the danger is in the inhaled poison it delivers. 
Traps employing gas usually have the never miss and onset delay features (see below).

\textbf{Liquid:} Any trap that involves a danger of drowning is in this category. 
Traps employing liquid usually have the never miss and onset delay features (see 
below). 

\textbf{Multiple Target:} Traps with this feature can affect more than one character.

\textbf{Never Miss:} When the entire dungeon wall moves to crush you, your quick 
reflexes won't help, since the wall can't possibly miss. A trap with this feature 
has neither an attack bonus nor a saving throw to avoid, but it does have an onset 
delay (see below). Most traps involving liquid or gas are of the never miss variety. 

\textbf{Onset Delay:} An onset delay is the amount of time between when the trap 
is sprung and when it deals damage. A never miss trap always has an onset delay.

\textbf{Poison: }Traps that employ poison are deadlier than their nonpoisonous 
counterparts, so they have correspondingly higher CRs. To determine the CR modifier 
for a given poison, consult Table: CR Modifiers for Mechanical Traps. Only injury, 
contact, and inhaled poisons are suitable for traps; ingested types are not. Some 
traps simply deal the poison's damage. Others deal damage with ranged or melee 
attacks as well. 

\textbf{Pit Spikes:} Treat spikes at the bottom of a pit as daggers, each with 
a +10 attack bonus. The damage bonus for each spike is +1 per 10 feet of pit depth 
(to a maximum of +5). Each character who falls into the pit is attacked by 1d4 
spikes. Pit spikes do not add to the average damage of the trap (see Average Damage, 
below).

\textbf{Pit Bottom:} If something other than spikes waits at the bottom of a pit, 
it's best to treat that as a separate trap (see Multiple Traps, below) with a location 
trigger that activates on any significant impact, such as a falling character. 

\textbf{Touch Attack:} This feature applies to any trap that needs only a successful 
touch attack (melee or ranged) to hit.

\vspace{12pt}
SAMPLE TRAPS

The costs listed for mechanical traps are market prices; those for magic traps 
are raw material costs. Caster level and class for the spells used to produce the 
trap effects are provided in the entries for magic device traps and spell traps. 
For all other spells used (in triggers, for example), the caster level is assumed 
to be the minimum required.

DESIGNING A TRAP

\textbf{Mechanical Traps: }Simply select the elements you want the trap to have 
and add up the adjustments to the trap's Challenge Rating that those elements require 
(see Table: CR Modifiers for Mechanical Traps) to arrive at the trap's final CR. 
From the CR you can derive the DC of the Craft (trapmaking) checks a character 
must make to construct the trap.

\textbf{Magic Traps:} As with mechanical traps, you don't have to do anything other 
than decide what elements you want and then determine the CR of the resulting trap 
(see Table: CR Modifiers for Magic Traps). If a player character wants to design 
and construct a magic trap, he must have the Craft Wondrous Item feat. In addition, 
he must be able to cast the spell or spells that the trap requires---or, failing 
that, he must be able to hire an NPC to cast the spells for him.

\vspace{12pt}
\subsubsection*{\textbf{Challenge Rating of a Trap}}

To calculate the Challenge Rating of a trap, add all the CR modifiers (see the 
tables below) to the base CR for the trap type.

\textbf{Mechanical Trap: }The base CR for a mechanical trap is 0. If your final 
CR is 0 or lower, add features until you get a CR of 1 or higher.

\textbf{Magic Trap:} For a spell trap or magic device trap, the base CR is 1. The 
highest-level spell used modifies the CR (see Table: CR Modifiers for Magic Traps).

\textbf{Average Damage:} If a trap (either mechanical or magic) does hit point 
damage, calculate the average damage for a successful hit and round that value 
to the nearest multiple of 7. Use this value to adjust the Challenge Rating of 
the trap, as indicated on the tables below. Damage from poisons and pit spikes 
does not count toward this value, but damage from a high strength rating and extra 
damage from multiple attacks does.

For a magic trap, only one modifier applies to the CR---either the level of the 
highest-level spell used in the trap, or the average damage figure, whichever is 
larger.

\textbf{Multiple Traps: }If a trap is really two or more connected traps that affect 
approximately the same area, determine the CR of each one separately.

\textit{Multiple Dependent Traps: }If one trap depends on the success of the other 
(that is, you can avoid the second trap altogether by not falling victim to the 
first), they must be treated as separate traps.

\textit{Multiple Independent Traps: }If two or more traps act independently (that 
is, none depends on the success of another to activate), use their CRs to determine 
their combined Encounter Level as though they were monsters\textit{. }The resulting 
Encounter Level is the CR for the combined traps.

\subsubsection*{\textbf{Mechanical Trap Cost}}

The base cost of a mechanical trap is 1,000 gp. Apply all the modifiers from Table: 
Cost Modifiers for Mechanical Traps for the various features you've added to the 
trap to get the modified base cost.

The final cost is equal to (modified base cost x Challenge Rating) + extra costs. 
The minimum cost for a mechanical trap is (CR x 100) gp.

After you've multiplied the modified base cost by the Challenge Rating, add the 
price of any alchemical items or poison you incorporated into the trap. If the 
trap uses one of these elements and has an automatic reset, multiply the poison 
or alchemical item cost by 20 to provide an adequate supply of doses.

\textbf{Multiple Traps:} If a trap is really two or more connected traps, determine 
the final cost of each separately, then add those values together. This holds for 
both multiple dependent and multiple independent traps (see the previous section).

\subsubsection*{\textbf{Magic Device Trap Cost}}

Building a magic device trap involves the expenditure of experience points as well 
as gold pieces, and requires the services of a spellcaster. Table: Cost Modifiers 
for Magic Device Traps summarizes the cost information for magic device traps. 
If the trap uses more than one spell (for instance, a sound or visual trigger spell 
in addition to the main spell effect), the builder must pay for them all (except 
\textit{alarm}, which is free unless it must be cast by an NPC; see below).

The costs derived from Table: Cost Modifiers for Magic Device Traps assume that 
the builder is casting the necessary spells himself (or perhaps some other PC is 
providing the spells for free). If an NPC spellcaster must be hired to cast them 
those costs must be factored in as well.

A magic device trap takes one day to construct per 500 gp of its cost.

it.

\subsubsection*{\textbf{Craft DCs for Mechanical Traps}}

Once you know the Challenge Rating of a trap determine the Craft (trapmaking) DC 
by referring to the table and the modifiers given below.

\vspace{12pt}
\textbf{Making the Checks: }To determine how much progress a character makes on 
building a trap each week, that character makes a Craft (trapmaking) check. See 
the Craft skill description for details on Craft checks and the circumstances that 
can affect them.
