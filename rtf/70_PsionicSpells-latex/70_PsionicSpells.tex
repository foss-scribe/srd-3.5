\subsubsection*{{\LARGE{}SPELL DESCRIPTIONS}}

The following spell descriptions are presented in alphabetical order.

\vspace{12pt}
Brain Spider

Divination [Mind-Affecting]

\textbf{Level: }Cleric 8, Mind 7

\textbf{Components:} V, S, M, DF

\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 round

\textbf{Range:} Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

\textbf{Targets:} Up to eight living creatures

\textbf{Duration:} 1 min./level

\textbf{Saving Throw:} Will negates

\textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes

This spell allows you to eavesdrop as a standard action on the thoughts of up to 
eight other creatures at once, hearing as desired:• 

\parindent=3pt
Individual trains of thought in whatever order you desire.• 

Information from all minds about one particular topic, thing, or being, one nugget 
of information per caster level.• 

\parindent=7pt
A study of the thoughts and memories of one creature of the group in detail.

\parindent=0pt
Once per round, if you do not perform a detailed study of one creature's mind, 
you can attempt (as a standard action) to implant a \textit{suggestion }in the 
mind of any one of the affected creatures. The creature can make another Will saving 
throw to resist the \textit{suggestion, }using the save DC of the \textit{brain 
spider }spell. (Creatures with special resistance to enchantment spells can use 
this resistance to keep from being affected by the \textit{suggestion.}) Success 
on this saving throw does not negate the other effects of the \textit{brain spider 
}spell for that creature.

You can affect all intelligent beings of your choice within range (up to the limit 
of eight), beginning with known or named beings. Language is not a barrier, and 
you need not personally know the beings The spell cannot reach those who make a 
successful Will save.

\textit{Material Component: }A spider of any size or kind. It can be dead, but 
must still have all eight legs.

\vspace{12pt}
Dweomer of Transference

Evocation

\textbf{Level: }Cleric 4, sorcerer/wizard 4

\textbf{Components:} V, S

\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 minute

\textbf{Range:} Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

\textbf{Target:} One willing psionic creature

\textbf{Duration:} 1 round/level

\textbf{Saving Throw:} Will negates (harmless)

\textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes (harmless)

With this spell, you form a radiating corona around the head of a psionic ally, 
then convert some of your spells into psionic power points. When you finish casting 
\textit{dweomer of transference, }a red-orange glow surrounds the psionic creature's 
head. For the duration of the spell, any spells cast at the subject don't have 
their usual effect, instead converting themselves harmlessly into psionic energy 
that the subject can use as energy for psionic powers. You can cast any spell you 
like at the subject, even area spells, effect spells, and spells for whom the subject 
would ordinarily not be a legitimate target. The spells don't do anything other 
than provide the subject with power points, but you must still cast them normally, 
obeying the component and range requirements listed in the description of each 
spell.

For each spell you cast into the \textit{dweomer of transference, }the psionic 
creature gets temporary power points, according to the following table. The transference 
isn't perfectly efficient. The temporary power points acquired through a \textit{dweomer 
of transference }dissipate after 1 hour if they haven't already been spent.

your ability to use spell activation or spell completion magic items, just as if 
those spells were no longer on your class list. For the duration of this spell, 
you use magic items and psionic items as if you were a psion with only the five 
powers given above on your class list.

deep below the surface to those still easily called to mind. You can learn the 
answer to one question per round, to the best of the subject's knowledge. You can 
also probe a sleeping subject, though the subject may make a Will save against 
the DC of the \textit{probe thoughts }spell to wake after each question. Subjects 
who do not wish to be probed can attempt to move beyond the power's range, unless 
somehow hindered. You pose the questions telepathically, and the answers to those 
questions are imparted directly to your mind. You and the target do not need to 
speak the same language, though less intelligent creatures may yield up only appropriate 
visual images in answer to your questions.

creatures within the area of the \textit{psychic turmoil }lose 1 power point per 
manifester level they have. Characters who succeed on a Will save when they first 
come into contact with the emanation lose only half as many power points (round 
down) each round. Characters get only one save attempt against any particular \textit{psychic 
turmoil }effect, even if they leave the spell's area and later return.
