\section*{{\LARGE{}EPIC FEATS }}

\vspace{12pt}
\subsection*{{\LARGE{}ACQUIRING EPIC FEATS}}

Characters gain epic feats in the following ways: 

At 21st level, and every three levels thereafter, the character may select an epic 
feat in place of a nonepic feat.

Each character class gains bonus epic feats according to the class description. 
These feats must be selected from the list of bonus epic feats for that class. 

\vspace{12pt}
\subsection*{{\LARGE{}PREREQUISITES}}

Most epic feats have prerequisites. A character must have the listed ability score, 
feat, skill, class feature, or base attack modifier in order to select or use that 
feat. A character can gain an epic feat at the same level at which he or she gains 
the prerequisite, just as with regular feats. A prerequisite expressed as a numerical 
value is a minimum; any value higher than the one given also meets the prerequisite. 
A character can't use an epic feat if he or she has lost a prerequisite. 

\vspace{12pt}
\subsection*{{\LARGE{}TYPES OF EPIC FEATS }}

Most epic feats are general, meaning that no special rules govern them as a group. 
Others may be item creation feats or metamagic feats, which follow all the normal 
rules for such feats, except as specified in the feat's description. In addition, 
some feats are defined as divine feats or as wild feats. Such feats are described 
below. 

\vspace{12pt}
\subsection*{DIVINE FEATS }

The feats in this category share a few characteristics. First, they all have as 
a prerequisite the ability to turn (or, in most cases, rebuke) undead. Thus, they 
are open to clerics, paladins of 4th level or higher, and any prestige class that 
has that ability. (An ability to turn other creatures does not qualify a character 
to select one of these feats.) Second, the force that powers a divine feat is the 
ability to channel positive or negative energy to turn or rebuke undead. Each use 
of a divine feat costs the character one turn/rebuke attempt from his or her number 
of attempts each day. If a character doesn't have any turn/rebuke attempts left, 
he or she can't use the feat. Since turning or rebuking is a standard action, activating 
any of these feats is also a standard action. 

\vspace{12pt}
\subsection*{WILD FEATS }

The feats in this category share the characteristic of relating to the ability 
to use \textit{wild shape }as a druid. These feats require the character to have 
the ability to use \textit{wild shape }before acquiring the feat. 

\vspace{12pt}
\subsection*{EPIC PSIONIC FEATS }

Psionic characters can acquire epic ``psionically flavored'' feats.  Some feats 
require so much translation that converted feats are provided. Whenever a feat 
concerns conferring or altering a spell in some fashion, some translation must 
be done to use it with psionics. Sometimes this translation is as straightforward 
as changing a few names. Translating epic metamagic feats to epic metapsionic feats 
requires that Spellcraft prerequisites be replaced with Psicraft. It also requires 
a little math---instead of casting a spell at a higher level, a psionic character 
pays more power points. For every spell slot one level higher than the spell's 
actual level the metamagic feat requires, the metapsionic feat requires a character 
to pay a power point cost equal to its standard cost +2. Likewise, when a feat 
allows a spellcaster to ``pay'' one less level to use a metamagic feat, the psionic 
version allows a character to pay 2 power points less for a given metapsionic feat. 

\vspace{12pt}
{\LARGE{}FEATS}

\vspace{12pt}
ADDITIONAL MAGIC ITEM SPACE [EPIC] 

\textbf{Benefit:} Choose one type of magic item that has a limit on the number 
a character can simultaneously wear and gain its benefit. The character can now 
wear one more magic item of this type and also gain its benefit. 

\textbf{Normal:} Without this feat, a character is limited to one headband, hat, 
or helmet; one pair of eye lenses or goggles; one cloak, cape, or mantle; one amulet, 
brooch, medallion, necklace, periapt, or scarab; one suit of armor; one robe; one 
vest, vestment, or shirt; one pair of bracers or bracelets; one pair of gloves 
or gauntlets; two rings; one belt; and one pair of boots. 

\textbf{Special:} A character can gain this feat multiple times. Each time the 
character takes the feat, it applies to a new type of wearable magic item. 

\vspace{12pt}
ARMOR SKIN [EPIC] 

\textbf{Benefit:} The character gains a +1 natural armor bonus to Armor Class, 
or his or her existing natural armor bonus increases by 1. 

\textbf{Special:} A character can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects stack. 

\vspace{12pt}
AUGMENTED ALCHEMY [EPIC] 

\textbf{Prerequisites:} Int 21, Craft(alchemy) 24 ranks. 

\textbf{Benefit:} Whenever creating an alchemical item or substance, the character 
can choose to make it more powerful than normal by adding +20 to the DC required 
to create it and multiplying its price by 5. If the item or substance deals damage, 
double the damage dealt. If the item or substance doesn't deal damage, double the 
duration of its effect. If the item or substance doesn't deal damage and doesn't 
have a specific listed duration (or has an instantaneous duration), double all 
dimensions of its area. If the item or substance doesn't fit any of these categories, 
then it cannot be affected by this feat. See the Craft (alchemy) skill description. 

\vspace{12pt}
AUTOMATIC QUICKEN SPELL [EPIC] 

\textbf{Prerequisites:} Quicken Spell, Spellcraft 30 ranks, ability to cast 9th-level 
arcane or divine spells. 

\textbf{Benefit:} The character may cast all 0-, 1st-, 2nd-, and 3rd-level spells 
as quickened spells without using higher-level spell slots. The normal limit to 
the number of quickened spells a character may cast per round applies. Spells with 
a casting time of more than 1 full round can't be quickened. 

\textbf{Special:} A character can gain this feat multiple times. Each time a character 
takes the feat, the spells of his or her next three lowest spell levels can now 
be quickened with no adjustment to their spell slots. This feat doesn't increase 
the casting time for those spells that normally become full-round actions when 
cast in metamagic form. 

\vspace{12pt}
AUTOMATIC SILENT SPELL [EPIC] 

\textbf{Prerequisites:} Silent Spell, Spellcraft 24 ranks, ability to cast 9th-level 
arcane or divine spells. 

\textbf{Benefit:} The character may cast all 0-, 1st-, 2nd-, and 3rd-level spells 
as silent spells without using higher-level spell slots. 

\textbf{Special:} A character can gain this feat multiple times. Each time a character 
takes the feat, the spells of his or her next three lowest spell levels can now 
be silenced with no adjustment to their spell slots. This feat doesn't increase 
the casting time for those spells that normally become full-round actions when 
cast in metamagic form. However, since bard spells can't be enhanced with the Silent 
Spell feat, they can't be affected by this feat either. 

\vspace{12pt}
AUTOMATIC STILL SPELL [EPIC] 

\textbf{Prerequisites:} Still Spell, Spellcraft 27 ranks, ability to cast 9th-level 
arcane or divine spells. 

\textbf{Benefit:} The character may cast all 0-, 1st-, 2nd-, and 3rd-level spells 
as stilled spells without using higher-level spell slots. 

\textbf{Special:} A character can gain this feat multiple times. Each time a character 
takes the feat, the spells of his or her next three lowest spell levels can now 
be stilled with no adjustment to their spell slots. This feat doesn't increase 
the casting time for those spells that normally become full-round actions when 
cast in metamagic form. 

\vspace{12pt}
BANE OF ENEMIES [EPIC] 

\textbf{Prerequisites:} Survival 24 ranks, five or more favored enemies. 

\textbf{Benefit:} Any weapon the character wields against one of his or her favored 
enemies is treated as a bane weapon for that creature type (thus, its enhancement 
bonus is increased by +2 and it deals +2d6 points of damage). This ability doesn't 
stack with similar abilities. 

\vspace{12pt}
BLINDING SPEED [EPIC] 

\textbf{Prerequisite:} Dex 25. 

\textbf{Benefit:} The character can act as if \textit{hasted }for 5 rounds each 
day. The duration of the effect need not be consecutive rounds. Activating this 
power is a free action. 

\textbf{Special:} A character can gain this feat multiple times. Each time he or 
she takes the feat, it grants an additional 5 rounds of \textit{haste }per day. 

\vspace{12pt}
BONUS DOMAIN [EPIC] 

\textbf{Prerequisites:} Wis 21, ability to cast 9th-level divine spells. 

\textbf{Benefit:} Choose an additional domain from the character's deity's domain 
list. The character now has access to that domain's spells as normal for his or 
her domain spells and the domain's granted powers. 

\textbf{Special:} A character can gain this feat multiple times. Each time he or 
she takes the feat, it applies to a different domain. 

\vspace{12pt}
BULWARK OF DEFENSE [EPIC] 

\textbf{Prerequisites:} Con 25, defensive stance 3/day. 

\textbf{Benefit:} The character's defensive stance bonuses increase to +4 Strength, 
+6 Constitution, +4 resistance bonus on all saves, and +6 dodge bonus to AC. 

\vspace{12pt}
CHAOTIC RAGE [EPIC] 

\textbf{Prerequisites:} Rage 5/day, chaotic alignment. 

\textbf{Benefit:} Any weapon the character wields while in a rage is treated as 
an anarchic weapon (it is chaos-aligned and deals an extra 2d6 points of damage 
against creatures of lawful alignment). This ability does not stack with similar 
abilities. 

\vspace{12pt}
COLOSSAL WILD SHAPE [WILD][EPIC] 

\textbf{Prerequisite:} The ability to \textit{wild shape }into a Gargantuan creatur\textit{e.}

\textbf{Benefit:} The character can use his or her \textit{wild shape }to take

DAMAGE REDUCTION [EPIC] 

\textbf{Prerequisite:} Con 21.

with damage reduction granted by magic items or nonpermanent magical effects, but 
it does stack with any damage reduction granted by permanent magical effects, class 
features, or this feat itself. 

\textbf{Special:} A character can gain this feat multiple times. Each time he or 
she gains the feat, his or her damage reduction increases by 3. 

\vspace{12pt}
DEAFENING SONG [EPIC] 

\textbf{Prerequisites:} Perform 24 ranks, bardic music class feature. 

\textbf{Benefit:} The character can use song or poetics to temporarily deafen all 
enemies within a 30-foot spread from him or her. A successful Fortitude save (DC 
10 + 1/2 the character's class level + the character's Charisma modifier) negates 
the effect. The deafening effect lasts for as long as the character continues the 
deafening song. The character can choose to exclude any characters from this effect. 
The character may sing, play, or recite a deafening song while taking other mundane 
actions, but not magical ones (see the bard's inspire courage ability for more 
details). The character may keep up the deafening song for a maximum of 10 rounds. 
Using the deafening song counts as one of the character's uses of song or poetics 
for the day. 

\vspace{12pt}
DEATH OF ENEMIES [EPIC] 

\textbf{Prerequisites:} Bane of Enemies, Survival 30 ranks, five or more favored 
enemies.

part of a charge. 

\vspace{12pt}
DISTANT SHOT [EPIC]

\textbf{Prerequisites:} Dex 25, Far Shot, Point Blank Shot, Spot 20 ranks. 

\textbf{Benefit:} The character may throw or fire a ranged weapon at any target

}6/day. 

\textbf{Benefit:} The character may use \textit{wild shape }to change into a dragon 
(black, blue, green, red, white, brass, bronze, copper, gold, or silver). The size

EFFICIENT ITEM CREATION [EPIC] 

\textbf{Prerequisites:} Item creation feat to be selected, Knowledge (arcana) 24 
ranks, Spellcraft 24 ranks.

(for spells that deal a number of dice of damage equal to caster level) or by 5 
dice (for spells that deal a number of dice of damage equal to half caster level). 
An enhanced spell uses up a spell slot four levels higher than the spell's actual 
level. This feat has no effect on spells that don't specifically deal a number 
of dice of damage equal to the caster's level or half level, even if the spell's 
effect is largely dictated by the caster's level. 

\textbf{Normal:} Without this feat, use the damage dice caps indicated in the spell's 
description.

plus any Charisma modifier. Outside factors can affect a character's Leadership 
score, as detailed in the Leadership feat.

Regardless of the character's Leadership score, he or she can't recruit a cohort 
of his or her level or higher. 

\textbf{Number of Followers by Level: }The character can lead up to the indicated 
number of characters of each level.

EPIC PROWESS [EPIC] 

\textbf{Benefit:} Gain a +1 bonus on all attacks. 

\textbf{Special:} A character can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects stack.

normal maximum power level in at least one psionic class.

\textbf{Benefit:} When you expend your psionic focus, you can simultaneously use 
two feats that require a psionic focus to be expended, instead of just one. The 
feats must be stackable. You must still spend the requisite power points required 
to use each metapsionic feat, and you cannot exceed the power point limit set by 
your manifester level.

\textbf{Special:} You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you do so, you 
can simultaneously use one additional feat that requires a psionic focus to be 
expended.

\vspace{12pt}

\subsection*{\textbf{Spell Slots Above 9th Level }}

\baselineskip=12pt
The Improved Spell Capacity feat allows characters to gain spell slots above 9th 
level (which can be used to hold lower-level spells or spells whose level has been 
increased beyond 9th by the use of metamagic feats).

A character with a very high score in the ability associated with his or her spellcasting 
(Intelligence for wizards; Wisdom for clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers; or 
Charisma for bards and sorcerers) may receive bonus spells of those levels, as 
shown on Table: Expanded Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells, but only if they already 
have at least one spell slot of that level (such as from the Improved Spell Capacity 
feat). A character without any spell slots of a level can't receive any bonus spells 
of that level, even if the appropriate ability score is high enough to award them.

Even though the table only includes ability scores up to 61 and spell slots up 
to 25th level, the progression continues infinitely in both directions. For ability 
scores beyond 61, or for spell slots above 25th level, expand the table to follow 
the same patterns as shown.

\textbf{Benefit:} As a standard action, the character can make one melee attack 
for every five points of his or her base attack bonus (including epic attack bonus, 
round fractions down).

The character cannot attack any one opponent more than once as part of this action. 
 These attacks (as well as all other attacks made until the start of the character's 
next turn) suffer a -4 penalty.

When using the Improved Whirlwind feat, the character also forfeits any bonus or 
extra attacks granted by other spells or abilities (such as Cleave or the haste 
spell).

Since these attacks are made as part of a standard action the character can't make 
a 5-foot step between any two of the attacks.

\textbf{Normal:} Without this feat, using the Whirlwind Attack feat requires a 
full attack action, and the character can take a 5-foot step between any two of 
the attacks. 

\vspace{12pt}
INCITE RAGE [EPIC] 

\textbf{Prerequisites:} Cha 25, greater rage class feature. 

\textbf{Benefit:} When the character enters a rage, he or she can incite a barbarian 
rage in any or all allies within 60 feet. (Any ally who doesn't wish to become 
enraged is unaffected.) The ally gains +4 to Strength, +4 to Constitution, and 
a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but takes a -2 penalty to AC, for as long as the 
character remains raging. The rage of affected allies lasts a number of rounds 
equal to 3 + their Constitution modifier, regardless of whether they remain within 
60 feet of the character. This is otherwise identical with normal barbarian rage 
(including the fatigue at its end). 

\textbf{Special:} This is a mind-affecting effect. 

\vspace{12pt}
INFINITE DEFLECTION [EPIC]

\textbf{Prerequisites:} Dex 25, Combat Reflexes, Deflect Arrows, Improved Unarmed 
Strike.

INSPIRE EXCELLENCE [EPIC] 

\textbf{Prerequisite:} Perform 30 ranks, bardic music class feature. 

\textbf{Benefit:} The character can use song or poetics to grant a bonus to one 
ability score to his or her allies. To be affected, an ally must hear the bard 
sing for 1 full round. The effect lasts as long as the bard sings and for 5 rounds 
after the bard stops singing (or 5 rounds after the ally can no longer hear the 
bard). While singing, the bard can fight but cannot cast spells, activate magic 
items by spell completion (such as scrolls), or activate magic items by command 
word (such as wands). Each ally to be inspired gains a +4 competence bonus to the 
same ability score, which the character must choose before he or she begins inspiring. 
Inspire excellence is a supernatural, mind-affecting ability. Use of this feat 
counts as one of the character's bardic music uses for the day.

\textbf{Special:} This feat is treated as a bardic music inspiration ability for 
purposes of feats that affect such abilities. 

\vspace{12pt}
INSTANT RELOAD [EPIC]

\textbf{Prerequisite:} Quick Draw, Rapid Reload, Weapon Focus (crossbow type to 
be selected). 

\textbf{Benefit:} The character may fire the selected type of crossbow at his or 
her full normal attack rate. Reloading the crossbow does not provoke attacks of 
opportunity. 

\textbf{Special:} A character can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do 
not stack. Each time a character takes the feat, it applies to a different type 
of crossbow. 

\vspace{12pt}
INTENSIFY SPELL [METAMAGIC][EPIC] 

\textbf{Prerequisites:} Empower Spell, Maximize Spell, Spellcraft 30 ranks, ability 
to cast 9th-level arcane or divine spells. 

\textbf{Benefit:} All variable, numeric effects of an intensified spell are maximized, 
then doubled. An intensified spell deals twice maximum damage, cures twice the 
maximum number of hit points, affects twice the maximum number of targets, and 
so forth, as appropriate. Saving throws and opposed rolls are not affected. An 
intensified spell uses up a spell slot seven levels higher than the spell's actual 
level. A character can't combine the effects of this feat with any other feat that 
affects the variable, numeric effects of a spell. 

\vspace{12pt}
KEEN STRIKE [EPIC] 

\textbf{Prerequisites:} Str 23, Wis 23, Improved Critical (unarmed strike), Improved 
Unarmed Strike, Stunning fist, \textit{ki }strike (adamantine). 

\textbf{Benefit:} The character's unarmed strike has a critical threat range of 
18-20 and deals slashing damage (at the character's option any attack can deal 
bludgeoning damage, but cannot then take advantage of the enhanced threat range). 
This ability doesn't stack with other abilities that expand that character's unarmed 
strike's threat range. 

\vspace{12pt}
LASTING INSPIRATION [EPIC] 

\textbf{Prerequisite:} Perform 25 ranks, bardic music class feature. 

\textbf{Benefit:} The effects of the character's bardic music inspiration abilities 
last for ten times as long as normal after he or she stops singing. This feat has 
no effect on inspiration abilities that have no duration after the character stops 
singing. 

\vspace{12pt}
LEGENDARY CLIMBER [EPIC]

\textbf{Prerequisites:} Dex 21, Balance 12 ranks, Climb 24 ranks. 

\textbf{Benefit:} The character can ignore any check penalties applied for accelerated 
climbing or rapid climbing.

in a round.

a mount without a saddle (bareback).  The character never needs to make a Ride 
check to control a mount in combat (and even controlling a mount not trained for 
combat doesn't require an action). 

\textbf{Normal:} Without this feat, a character takes a -5 penalty on Ride checks 
without a saddle, and must make a Ride check to control a mount in combat (and 
controlling a mount not trained for combat requires a move action). 

\vspace{12pt}
LEGENDARY TRACKER [EPIC] 

\textbf{Prerequisites:} Wis 25, Track, Knowledge (nature) 30 ranks, Survival 30 
ranks. 

\textbf{Benefit:} The character can track creatures across water, under-water,

\textbf{Benefit:} The character can use one rebuke or command undead attempt to

command) check, except that the negative energy burst affects living creatures 
rather than undead. Any creature that would be rebuked by this result gains one 
negative level. Any creature that would be commanded by this check gains two negative 
levels. The Fortitude save DC to remove these levels one day later is equal to 
10 + 1/2 the character's effective turning level + the character's Charisma modifier. 

\vspace{12pt}

\textbf{Prerequisites:} Str 23, Cleave, Great Cleave, Improved Critical (chosen 
weapon), Power Attack, Weapon Focus (chosen weapon).

permanent. 

\textbf{Benefit:} Designate any one of the character's spells whose area is an

spell to become permanent. 

\vspace{12pt}
PLANAR TURNING [EPIC] 

\textbf{Prerequisites:} Wis 25, Cha 25, ability to turn or rebuke undead.

a turning attempt, and the character doesn't have to roll turning damage (it automatically 
affects all undead in a 15-foot burst), but it only turns undead with Hit Dice 
equal to or less than the character's effective cleric level minus 10 (and automatically 
destroys undead with Hit Dice equal to or less than the character's effective cleric 
level minus 20). Just as with normal turning, the character can't affect undead

gains sufficient power points to manifest the power once). You cannot bestow a 
power upon your psicrystal if the power normally has any experience point cost.

\textbf{Special: }You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time you take the 
feat, you can give your psicrystal knowledge of a new power (and it gains sufficient 
power points to manifest that power once).

go into its reserve and can be used to manifest the powers it knows as you desire.

\vspace{12pt}
RANGED INSPIRATION [EPIC] 

\textbf{Prerequisite:} Bardic music class feature, Perform 25 ranks

\textbf{Benefit:} The character can begin a countersong at any time, even when 
it isn't his or her turn (much like a wizard who has readied a counterspell action), 
though the character doesn't have to ready an action to do so. The character can't 
use Reactive Countersong at the same time he or she isusing another bardic music 
ability (though the character could stop the other bardic music ability to begin 
Reactive Countersong if so desired).

RUINOUS RAGE [EPIC] 

\textbf{Prerequisites:} Str 25, Improved Sunder, Power Attack, rage 5/day. 

\textbf{Benefit:} While in a rage, the character ignores the hardness of any object

dealing normal damage (including bursting bindings, such as ropes or manacles). 

\vspace{12pt}
SCRIBE EPIC SCROLL [ITEM CREATION][EPIC] 

\textbf{Prerequisites:} Scribe Scroll, Knowledge (arcana) 24 ranks, Spellcraft

the miss chance increases by 10\% to a maximum of 50\% after it has been taken 
five times.

strike), Concentration 25 ranks, \textit{ki }strike (adamantine). 

\textbf{Benefit:} When using an unarmed strike to attempt to break an object with 
sudden force (rather than by dealing normal damage), make a Concentration check 
rather than a Strength check. The break DC remains the same. Using Shattering Strike 
is a full-round action that incurs attacks of opportunity. The character can't 
use Shattering Strike to escape bonds (unless he or she is so bound as to allow 
the character to make an unarmed strike against his or her bindings). 

\vspace{12pt}

SPELL OPPORTUNITY [EPIC] 

\textbf{Prerequisites:} Combat Casting, Combat Reflexes, Quicken Spell, Spellcraft 
25 ranks. 

\textbf{Benefit:} Whenever the character is allowed an attack of opportunity, he 
or she may cast (and attack with) a touch spell as the character's attack of opportunity. 
This incurs attacks of opportunity just as if the character had cast the spell 
normally.

an attack of opportunity. 

\vspace{12pt}
SPELL STOWAWAY [EPIC] 

\textbf{Prerequisites:} Spellcraft 24 ranks, caster level 12th. 

\textbf{Benefit:} Choose a spell-like ability the character knows, or a spell the 
character cam cast.  The character is attuned to the magic he or she chooses. If 
another spellcaster within 300 feet of the character uses this magic, the character 
also immediately gains the magic's effect as if it had been used on the character 
by the same caster. The character must have direct line of effect to the spellcaster 
in order to gain the benefit of the attuned magic (though the character does not 
have to know the spellcaster is present, and he or she can be flat-footed). The 
magic's duration, effect, and other specifics are determined by its original caster's 
level. 

\textbf{Special:} A character can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do 
not stack. Each time a character takes the feat, it applies to a different spell 
or spell-like ability. 

\vspace{12pt}
SPELLCASTING HARRIER [EPIC]

divine spells. 

\textbf{Benefit:} Select a domain the character has access to. The character may 
spontaneously convert any prepared cleric spell (except a domain spell) into a 
domain spell of the same level in the selected domain, just as a cleric channels 
energy to convert spells into \textit{cure }spells. 

\textbf{Special:} A character can gain this feat multiple times. Each time a character 
takes the feat, it applies to a different domain. 

\vspace{12pt}
SPONTANEOUS SPELL [EPIC]

spell level of at least one spell-casting class.

\vspace{12pt}
TENACIOUS MAGIC [EPIC] 

\textbf{Prerequisites:} Spellcraft 15 ranks. 

\textbf{Benefit:} Choose one spell the character knows or spell-like ability the 
character possesses. Whenever the chosen form of magic would otherwise end due 
to a \textit{dispel }effect, the magic is instead only suppressed for 1d4 rounds. 
The magic still ends when its duration expires, but the suppressed rounds do not 
count against its duration. The character can dismiss his or her own spell or spell-like 
ability (if dismissible) or dispel his or her own tenacious magic normally. 

\textbf{Special:} A character can gain this feat multiple times. Each time he or 
she takes the feat, it applies to a different spell or spell-like ability.

Two-Weapon Fighting. 

\textbf{Benefit:} If the character hits an opponent with a weapon in each hand 
in the same round, he or she may automatically rend the opponent. This deals additional 
damage equal to the base damage of the smaller weapon plus 1 1/2 times the character's 
Strength modifier. Base weapon damage includes an enhancement bonus on damage, 
if any. The character can only rend once per round, regardless of how many successful 
attacks he or she makes. 

\vspace{12pt}
UNCANNY ACCURACY [EPIC]

\textbf{Prerequisites:} Dex 21, base attack bonus +11, Point Blank Shot, Precise 
Shot, Improved Precise Shot, Spot 20 ranks.

a ranged attack against a target with total concealment.

this feat even if he or she does not have the prerequisites for it, but can only 
use it when wearing light or no armor.

\textbf{Benefit:} Any weapon the character wields is treated as an unholy weapon 
(it is evil-aligned and deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against creatures of 
good alignment). This ability doesn't stack with similar abilities. If the weapon 
already has an alignment, this feat has no effect on the weapon.

\vspace{12pt}
VERMIN WILD SHAPE [WILD][EPIC] 

\textbf{Prerequisites:} Knowledge (nature) 24 ranks, \textit{wild shape }6/day. 

\textbf{Benefit:} The character can use his or her normal \textit{wild shape }ability 
to take the form of a vermin. The size limitation is the same as the character's 
limitation on animal size. 

\vspace{12pt}
VORPAL STRIKE [EPIC] 

\textbf{Prerequisites:} Str 25, Wis 25, Improved Critical (unarmed strike), Improved 
Unarmed Strike, Keen Strike, Stunning Fist, \textit{ki }strike (adamantine). 

\textbf{Benefit:} The character's unarmed strike is considered to be a slashing 
vorpal weapon. (At the character's option, any unarmed strike can do bludgeoning 
damage instead, but it loses the vorpal quality.) This ability doesn't stack with 
similar abilities

\vspace{12pt}
WIDEN AURA OF COURAGE [EPIC]

\textbf{Prerequisite:} Cha 25, aura of courage class ability.

ZONE OF ANIMATION [DIVINE][EPIC]

\textbf{Prerequisite:} Cha 25, Undead Mastery, ability to rebuke or command undead. 

\textbf{Benefit:} The character can use a rebuke or command undead attempt to animate 
corpses within range of his or her rebuke or command attempt. The character animates 
a total number of HD of undead equal to the number of undead that would be commanded 
by the character's result (though the character can't animate more undead than 
there are available corpses within range). The character can't animate more undead 
with any single attempt than the maximum number he or she can command (including 
any undead already under his or her command). These undead are automatically under 
the character's command, though his or her normal limit of commanded undead still 
applies. If the corpses are relatively fresh, the animated undead are zombies. 
Otherwise, they are skeletons.
