\subsection*{{\LARGE{}SCROLLS }}

To generate an epic scroll randomly, first roll on Table: Scroll Types to determine 
whether the spells are arcane or divine. An epic scroll contains 1d8 spells. For 
each spell, roll on Table: Epic Scroll Spell Levels to determine its level and 
then on the appropriate section of Table: Actual Spell Levels to determine the 
spell's actual level and total metamagic level adjustments. To determine the specific 
metamagic level adjustments, roll on the appropriate section of Table: Metamagic 
Level Adjustment to Spells. To determine the spell, use the appropriate sections 
of the nonepic scroll tables.

against their spells in such cases where those values would be higher than the 
listed values for the staffs.

bounded space, such as a doorway or a cave opening, to another bounded space on 
another plane of existence previously visited by the wielder. When two bounded 
spaces are attuned, an interdimensional portal springs up at each location, and 
the two portals are connected. When the wielder creates a pair of portals, he or 
she also establishes the necessary key that travelers must have to access the portal.

key }itself. Up to sixty different pairs of portals can be attuned in this manner. 
Once all sixty pairs of portals are created, the key cannot create additional gates,

\vspace{12pt}
\subsection*{{\LARGE{}INTELLIGENT ITEMS }}

Just like nonepic magic items, epic magic items sometimes possess intelligence 
of their own. Such items are fully sentient and should be treated as NPCs. The 
Random Epic Magic Items section details the chances that epic armor, shields, rings, 
rods, staffs, wondrous items, and weapons might be intelligent. In short, a ring, 
rod, staff, wondrous item, armor, or shield has a 1\% chance to be intelligent, 
a ranged weapon has a 5\% chance to be intelligent, and a melee weapon has a 15\% 
chance to be intelligent. Rather than using the tables for nonepic items\textit{, 
}use the tables below to determine the properties of an intelligent item: the number 
of powers, unusual properties, alignment, and special purpose of the item (if any). 
Of the three mental ability scores, two scores are favored (2d6 + some number) 
and one is completely random (3d6). Choose which scores get assigned which number, 
or roll 1d4 and determine randomly according to the following table. 

\vspace{12pt}
\textbf{Table: Mental Ability Scores for Intelligent Items }

\begin{tabular}{|>{\raggedright}p{14pt}|>{\raggedright}p{46pt}|>{\raggedright}p{61pt}|>{\raggedright}p{44pt}|}
\hline
1\textbf{d4 } & H\textbf{igh Score } & M\textbf{edium Score } & L\textbf{ow Score 
}\tabularnewline
\hline
1  & Intelligence  & Charisma  & Wisdom\tabularnewline
\hline
2  & Intelligence  & Wisdom  & Charisma \tabularnewline
\hline
3  & Wisdom  & Intelligence  & Charisma \tabularnewline
\hline
4  & Charisma  & Intelligence  & Wisdom \tabularnewline
\hline
\end{tabular}

\vspace{12pt}
The first step in determining the properties of a random intelligent epic magic 
item is to determine its general capabilities. These are found by rolling d\% and 
consulting Table: Epic Items Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and Capabilities. 

\vspace{12pt}
\textbf{Table: Epic Item Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and Capabilities }

\end{tabular}

\vspace{12pt}
\subsection*{MARKET PRICE MODIFIER }

To find the market price for an epic magic item, use these expanded guidelines, 
adjusting as necessary to find an appropriate final price. Each point of Intelligence 
bonus, Wisdom bonus, or Charisma bonus increases the item's market price by 400 
gp. Any form of communication possessed by the item increases its market price 
by the number shown on Table: Epic Item Communication. Each primary ability possessed 
by the item increases its market price by 2,000 to 10,000 gp (average 6,000 gp). 
Each extraordinary ability possessed by the item increases its market price by 
15,000 to 35,000 gp (average 25,000 gp). A special purpose increases the item's 
market price by 50,000 gp. An awesome power increases the item's market price by 
100,000 gp. 

\vspace{12pt}
\subsection*{INTELLIGENT ITEM ALIGNMENT }

Any item with Intelligence has an alignment. Make sure that the alignment choosen 
or determine randomly (using Table: Item Alignment) matches any alignment-oriented 
special abilities of the item. Any character whose alignment is not compatible 
with that of the item gains one negative level for every 10 points of the weapon's 
Ego (see Item Ego, below) if he or she so much as picks up the item. Although this 
never results in actual level loss, the negative levels remain as long as the item 
is in hand and cannot be overcome in any way (including \textit{restoration }spells). 
These negative levels are cumulative with any other penalties the item might already 
place on inappropriate wielders.

\vspace{12pt}
If the same ability is rolled twice or more, the range, frequency, or effectiveness 
of the power is doubled, tripled, and so on. All abilities function only when the 
item is held, drawn, or otherwise brandished and the possessor is concentrating 
on the desired result. Activating a power is a standard action, but using a free 
feat is not. Feats may be used regardless of prerequisites, but the item still 
must be held and drawn (or worn, in the case of such items). An intelligent item 
might activate a power on its own.

\vspace{12pt}
\subsection*{SPECIAL PURPOSE POWER }

A special purpose power operates only when the item is in pursuit of its special 
purpose. This is always up to the purview of the item. It should always be easy 
and straightforward to see how the ends justify the means. That is to say that 
if the player's reasoning for how a particular action serves the item's purpose 
is not completely believable, the item won't allow it.

\subsection*{ITEM EGO }

Ego is a measure of the total power and force of personality that an item possesses. 
Only after all aspects of an item have been generated and recorded can its Ego 
score be determined. Ego is a factor with regard to the dominance of item over 
character, as detailed below.

\end{tabular}

\vspace{12pt}
\subsection*{ITEMS AGAINST CHARACTERS }

When an item has an Ego of its own, it has a will of its own. The item is, of course, 
absolutely true to its alignment. If the character who possesses the item is not 
true to that alignment's goals or the item's special purpose, personality conflict---item 
against character---results. Similarly, any item with an Ego score of 20 or higher 
always considers itself superior to any character, and a personality conflict results 
if the possessor does not always agree with the item. When a personality conflict 
occurs, the possessor must make a Will saving throw (DC = item's Ego). If the possessor 
succeeds, he or she is dominant. If he or she fails, the item is dominant. Dominance 
lasts for one day or until a critical situation occurs (such as a major battle, 
a serious threat to either item or character, and so on). Should an item gain dominance, 
it resists the character's desires and demands concessions such as any of the following: 
• 

\parindent=3pt
Removal of associates or items whose alignment or personality is distasteful to 
the item. • 

The character divesting him or herself of all other magic items or items of a certain 
type. • 

\parindent=7pt
Obedience from the character so the item can direct where they go for its own purposes. 
• 

\parindent=3pt
Immediate seeking out and slaying of creatures hateful to the item. • 

Magical protections and devices to protect the item from molestation when it is 
not in use. • 

\parindent=7pt
That the character carry the item with him or her on all occasions. • 

\parindent=3pt
That the character relinquish the item in favor of a more suitable possessor due 
to alignment differences or conduct. 

\vspace{12pt}
\parindent=0pt
In extreme circumstances, the item can resort to even harsher measures. • 

\parindent=3pt
Force its possessor into combat. • 

Refuse to strike opponents. • 

\parindent=7pt
Strike at its wielder or his or her associates. • 

\parindent=3pt
Force its possessor to surrender to an opponent. • 

Cause itself to drop from the character's grasp. 

\vspace{12pt}
Naturally, such actions are unlikely when harmony reigns between the character's 
and item's alignments or when their purposes and personalities are well matched. 
Even so, an item might wish to have a lesser character possess it in order to easily 
command him or her, or a higher-level possessor so as to better accomplish its 
goals. All magic items with personalities desire to play an important role in whatever 
activity is under way, particularly combat. Such items are rivals of each other, 
even if they are of the same alignment. No intelligent item wants to share its 
wielder with others. An intelligent item is aware of the presence of any other 
intelligent item within 60 feet, and most intelligent items try their best to mislead 
or distract their host so that he or she ignores or destroys the rival. Of course, 
alignment might change this sort of behavior. 

Items with personalities are never totally controlled or silenced by the characters 
who possess them, even though they may never successfully control their possessor. 
They may be powerless to force their demands but remain undaunted and continue 
to air their wishes and demands.

\vspace{12pt}
\subsection*{MINOR ARTIFACTS }

\parindent=0pt
Minor artifacts are not necessarily unique items, but rather magic items that no 
longer can be made by common mortal means---even by the hands of epic creators. 
Such items have no established market price. Below is a selection of known minor 
artifacts. 

\vspace{12pt}
\textbf{Everfull Purse: }This leather belt pouch has the power to turn a single 
gold coin into many overnight. If a single gold piece is placed in the \textit{everfull 
purse }at sunset, it will be replaced at sunrise by 25 gold pieces. The \textit{purse 
}has no effect if more than one gold piece is left within, or if anything other 
than gold is placed within. 

\textit{Caster Level: }20th; \textit{Weight: }1/2 lb. 

\textbf{Libram of Gainful Conjuration: }This mystic book is of great value to arcane 
spellcasters of good alignment (LG, NG, CG). Study of the work requires one week. 
Upon completion, the good arcane caster gains a +1 inherent bonus to the ability 
score controlling his or her arcane spellcasting ability and experience points 
sufficient to place him or her halfway into the next level of experience. (If the 
reader has levels in more than one arcane spellcasting class, he or she must choose 
one of the classes to be affected.) Nongood arcane spellcasters (LN, N, CN, LE, 
NE, or CE) are permanently drained of 1d4+1 points of Constitution and must atone 
(see the \textit{atonement }spell) in order to gain any further experience. Anyone 
incapable of casting arcane spells who reads even a single word of the work must 
make a Will save (DC 20) or suffer insanity (see the \textit{insanity }spell). 
Except as indicated above, the writing in a \textit{libram of gainful conjuration 
}can't be distinguished from any other book, libram, tome, or so on until perused. 
Once read, the book vanishes, never to be seen again, nor can the same character 
ever benefit from reading a similar tome a second time. 

\textit{Caster Level: }19th; \textit{Weight: }3 lb. 

\textbf{Libram of Ineffable Damnation: }This mystic book is of great value to arcane 
spellcasters of evil alignment (LE, NE, CE). Study of the work requires one week. 
Upon completion, the evil arcane caster gains a +1 inherent bonus to the ability 
score controlling his or her arcane spell-casting ability and experience points 
sufficient to place him or her halfway into the next level of experience. (If the 
reader has levels in more than one arcane spellcasting class, he or she must choose 
one of the classes to be affected.) Nonevil arcane spellcasters (LN, N, CN, LG, 
NG, or CG) are permanently drained of 1d4+1 points of Constitution and must atone

}can't be distinguished from any other book, libram, tome, or so on until perused. 
Once read, the book vanishes, never to be seen again, nor can the same character 
ever benefit from reading a similar tome a second time. 

\textit{Caster Level: }19th; \textit{Weight: }3 lb. 

\textbf{Libram of Silver Magic: }This mystic book is of great value to arcane spellcasters 
of neutral alignment (LN, N, CN). Study of the work requires one week. Upon completion, 
the neutral arcane caster gains a +1 inherent bonus to the ability score controlling 
his or her arcane spellcasting ability and experience points sufficient to place 
him or her halfway into the next level of experience. (If the reader has levels 
in more than one arcane spellcasting class, he or she must choose one of the classes 
to be affected.) Evil or good arcane spellcasters (LE, NE, CE, LG, NG, or CG) are 
permanently drained of 1d4+1 points of Constitution and must atone (see the \textit{atonement 
}spell) in order to gain any further experience. Anyone incapable of casting arcane 
spells who reads even a single word of the work must make a Will save (DC 20) or 
suffer insanity (see the \textit{insanity }spell). Except as indicated above, the 
writing in a \textit{libram of silver magic }can't be distinguished from any other 
book, libram, tome, or so on until perused. Once read, the book vanishes, never 
to be seen again, nor can the same character ever benefit from reading a similar 
tome a second time. 

\textit{Caster Level: }19th; \textit{Weight: }3 lb. 

\textbf{Manual of Puissant Skill at Arms: }This treatise contains expert advice 
and instruction in the arts of combat. Any barbarian, fighter, monk, paladin, or 
ranger who spends one week studying the manual gains a +1 inherent bonus to Strength 
and experience points sufficient to place him or her halfway into the next level 
of experience. (If the reader has levels in more than one of the classes listed, 
he or she must choose one of the classes to be affected.) A character without any 
levels in one of the classes listed gains no bonus from the work, but if an arcane 
spellcaster without levels in one of the classes listed scans even a single word 
he or she will lose 2dx1,000 XP and must make a Will save (DC 20) or have 1 point 
of Intelligence permanently drained. Except as indicated above, the writing in 
a \textit{manual of puissant skill at arms }can't be distinguished from any other 
book, libram, tome, or so on until perused. Once read, the book vanishes, never 
to be seen again, nor can the same character ever benefit from reading a similar 
tome a second time. 

\textit{Caster Level: }19th; \textit{Weight: }3 lb. 

\textbf{Manual of Stealthy Pilfering: }This guide to thievery grants any rogue 
who spends a week studying its lessons a +1 inherent bonus to Dexterity and experience 
points sufficient to place him or her halfway into the next level of experience. 
A character without any rogue levels gains no bonus from the work, but if a divine 
spellcaster without rogue levels scans even a single word she will lose 2dx1,000 
XP and must make a Will save (DC 20) or have 1 point of Wisdom permanently drained. 
Except as indicated above, the writing in a \textit{manual of stealthy pilfering 
}can't be distinguished from any other book, libram, tome, or so on until perused. 
Once read, the book vanishes, never to be seen again, nor can the same character 
ever benefit from reading a similar tome a second time.

\textbf{Rogue's Dice: }This pair of cubes appears much like any other pair of typical 
(6-sided) dice. A character with a pair of \textit{rogue's dice }who wishes to 
roll them must announce that he or she is rolling the dice (accidental rolls have 
no effect). Rolling the dice is a standard action, and both dice must be rolled 
simultaneously to have any effect. The player should roll 2d6 and consult the table 
below to determine the \textit{dice's }affects. 

\begin{tabular}{|>{\raggedright}p{14pt}|>{\raggedright}p{272pt}|}
\hline
2\textbf{d6 } & E\textbf{ffect }\tabularnewline
\hline
2  & Lose 10,000 XP and dice roll again next round \tabularnewline
\hline
3  & Permanently lose 1d4+1 Dex \tabularnewline
\hline
4  & Gain 1d4 negative levels (Fortitude DC 20 to remove) \tabularnewline
\hline
5 - & 1 penalty on all attacks, saves, and checks for 1 hour \tabularnewline
\hline
6 - & 4 penalty to AC for 10 minutes \tabularnewline
\hline
7  & +1 morale bonus on attacks and on saves against fear for 10 minutes \tabularnewline
\hline
8  & Gain effects of \textit{blur }for 10 minutes \tabularnewline
\hline
9  & +1 insight bonus on all attacks, saves, and checks for 1 hour \tabularnewline
\hline
10  & Gain effects of \textit{freedom of movement }for 1 hour \tabularnewline
\hline
11  & Gain one \textit{limited wish }(must be used within 1 minute) \tabularnewline

12  & Gain 10,000 XP and may roll again next round \tabularnewline
\hline
\end{tabular}

No character can gain any effect from an additional roll of the dice within 24 
hours, with two exceptions. If a 2 is rolled, the dice automatically roll themselves 
at the beginning of the character's next turn and he or she must accept the additional 
result. If a 12 is rolled, the character may choose to roll again in the next round 
(if more than 1 full round elapses between the roll of 12 and this bonus roll, 
the character loses the bonus roll). There is no method (mundane or magical) to 
predict or influence the result of a roll of \textit{Rogue's dic}e. Even powerful 
divination magic can't predict the outcome of a roll before it is made.

\subsection*{{\LARGE{}MAJOR ARTIFACTS }}

\vspace{12pt}
\textbf{Axe of the Dwarvish Lords: }This is a +\textit{6 keen throwing goblinoid 
bane dwarven waraxe}. Any dwarf who holds it doubles the range of his or her darkvision. 
Any nondwarf who grasps the \textit{Axe }takes 2 points of temporary Charisma damage; 
these points cannot be healed or restored in any way while the \textit{Axe }is 
held. The current owner of the \textit{Axe }gains a +10 bonus on Craft (armorsmithing, 
blacksmithing, gemcutting, stonemasonry, and weaponsmithing) checks. The wielder 
of the \textit{Axe }can summon an elder earth elemental (as \textit{summon monster 
IX; }duration 20 rounds) once per week. 

\textbf{Codex of the Infinite Planes: }The \textit{Codex} is enormous---supposedly, 
it requires two strong men to lift it. No matter how many pages are turned, another 
always remains. Anyone opening the \textit{Codex }for the first time is utterly 
annihilated, as with a \textit{destruction }spell (Fortitude DC 30 for only 10d6 
damage). Those who survive can peruse its pages and learn its powers, though not 
without risk. Each day spent studying the \textit{Codex }allows the reader to make 
a Spellcraft check (DC 50) to learn one of its powers (choose the power learned 
randomly; add a +1 circumstance bonus on the check per additional day spent reading 
until a power is learned). However, each day of study also forces the reader to 
make a Will save (DC 30 + 1 per day of study) to avoid being driven insane (as 
the \textit{insanity }spell). The powers of the \textit{Codex of the Infinite Planes 
}are as follows: \textit{astral projection, banishment, elemental swarm, gate, 
greater planar ally, greater planar binding, plane shift, }and \textit{soul bind. 
}Each is usable at will by the owner of the \textit{Codex }(assuming that he or 
she has learned how to access the power). The \textit{Codex of the Infinite Planes 
}has a caster level of 30th for the purposes of all powers and catastrophes, and 
all saving throw DCs are 20 + spell level. Activating any power requires both a 
Concentration check and a Spellcraft check (DC 40 + twice the spell level of the 
power; the character can't take 10 on this check). Any failure on either check 
indicates a catastrophe befalls the user (roll on the table below for the effect). 
A character can only incur one catastrophe per power use, even if he or she fails 
both checks. 

\begin{tabular}{|>{\raggedright}p{27pt}|>{\raggedright}p{299pt}|}
\hline
d\textbf{\%} & C\textbf{atastrophe }\tabularnewline
\hline
01-25 & Natural Fury: An \textit{earthquake }spell centered on the reader strikes 
every round for 1 minute, and an intensified \textit{storm of vengeance }spell 
is centered and targeted on the reader. \tabularnewline
\hline
26-50 & Fiendish Vengeance: A \textit{gate }opens and 1d3+1 balor demons, pit fiends, 
or similar evil outsiders immediately step through and attempt to destroy the owner 
of the \textit{Codex. }\tabularnewline
\hline
51-75 & Ultimate Imprisonment: Reader's soul is captured (as \textit{trap the soul; 
}no save allowed) in a random gem somewhere on the plane while his or her body 
is entombed beneath the earth (as \textit{imprisonmen}t). \tabularnewline
\hline
76-100 & Death: The reader utters a \textit{wail of the banshee }and then is subject 
to a \textit{destruction }spell. This repeats every round for 10 rounds until the 
reader is dead. \tabularnewline
\hline
\end{tabular}

\textbf{Cup and Talisman of the Demigod: }The \textit{Cup }is a large gem-set golden 
chalice requiring two hands to lift. It emits light (as the \textit{daylight }spell) 
at all times and automatically dispels any darkness-based spells whose area it 
enters. If the cup is filled with holy water (requiring a full gallon), that substance 
will act as a \textit{potion of cure critical wounds }or a \textit{potion of neutralize 
poison }(owner's choice) if drunk. This liquid can't be saved or stored in any 
way. The \textit{Talisman }is a small eight-pointed platinum star hanging from 
a chain of gold and pearls. The wearer gains a +6 enhancement bonus to Charisma 
and may cast \textit{remove blindness/deafness, remove curse, }and \textit{remove 
disease }at will. Furthermore, if the \textit{Talisman }is placed within the \textit{Cup 
}and the \textit{Cup }filled with holy water, that liquid acts as a special elixir 
of \textit{resurrection }(as the spell). This effect will function only once per 
month. Any evil or chaotic creature that touches the \textit{Cup }or \textit{Talisman 
}is struck with a \textit{holy word }(if evil) or \textit{dictum }(if chaotic) 
spell (or both if the creature is chaotic evil). 

\textbf{Eye of the Orc: }This lump of rock has a marquis-cut black sapphire set 
in its center, making it appear similar to a large eye. If possessed by an orc, 
it grants a +6 enhancement bonus to Strength and Charisma, and the orc's darkvision 
range is doubled. Nonorcs who possess the \textit{Eye }gain a +2 enhancement bonus 
to Strength but take a -2 penalty to Intelligence and Charisma. Regardless of the 
owner's race, any weapon wielded by the owner of the \textit{Eye }is considered 
an \textit{elf bane weapo}n. Furthermore, by holding the \textit{Eye }before the 
character, he or she can perceive things as if he or she had \textit{true seeing 
}cast upon him or her. This can be activated only once per day but lasts as long 
as the character concentrates on it (requiring a standard action each round). 

\textbf{Golem Armor: }This enormous suit of black iron +\textit{10 full plate armor 
}increases the wearer's size by one category (to a maximum of Colossal). The wearer 
gains a +10 enhancement bonus to Strength and is rendered immune to mind-affecting 
effects, poison, disease, and similar effects. He or she is not subject to critical 
hits, subdual damage, ability damage, energy drain, or death from massive damage. 
\textit{Golem Armor }is immune to rust attacks. The wearer of \textit{Golem Armor 
}gains damage reduction 15/adamantine. He or she also cannot regain hit points 
by any means (mundane or magical) while the armor is worn. It requires 1 hour to 
don or extract oneself from \textit{Golem Armo}r. 

\textbf{Invulnerable Coat: }The \textit{Invulnerable Coat }+\textit{5 chain shirt 
of heavy fortificatio}n. It grants its wearer damage reduction 10/epic and resistance 
20 against acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic energy. If the wearer can turn 
undead, treat the wearer as having +4 class levels for purposes of caster level, 
turning undead, smiting evil, and laying on hands. 

\textbf{Iron Gauntlet of War: }The \textit{Gauntlet }grants a +8 enhancement bonus 
to Strength. The wearer doubles the damage bonus on any smite attacks he or she 
makes. If the wearer has the Leadership feat, the wearer's Leadership score increases 
by +4, but the wearer can never attract or keep followers or cohorts who are good 
or chaotic. Once per day, the wielder can use \textit{implosion }as a 20th-level 
caster (DC 23). The \textit{Iron Gauntlet of War }is intelligent (Int 13, Wis 18, 
Cha 24, Ego 26) and lawful evil. It can communicate telepathically with its wearer, 
though it cannot speak. It will always seek to dominate any wearer who isn't lawful 
evil, forcing such an owner to commit lawful evil deeds (or else find a more suitable 
wearer). 

\textbf{Ring of Nine Facets: }This ring is set with a gem of nine facets, each 
one in-scribed with a different incomprehensible rune. Each day at sunrise, the 
gem turns to display a different facet. The active facet determines the \textit{Rin}g's 
power for that day. Each day, roll 1d10 to determine which facet (and thus which 
power) is active.

\vspace{12pt}
\begin{tabular}{|>{\raggedright}p{19pt}|>{\raggedright}p{204pt}|}
\hline
1\textbf{d10} & A\textbf{ctive Facet Power }\tabularnewline
\hline
1  & Wearer is immune to disease \tabularnewline
\hline
2  & Wearer needs no air to survive \tabularnewline
\hline
3  & Wearer gains +5 natural armor bonus \tabularnewline
\hline
4  & Wearer gains low-light vision \tabularnewline
\hline
5  & Wearer gains fast healing 1 \tabularnewline

6  & Wearer can \textit{fly }at will \tabularnewline

7  & Wearer gains cold resistance 30 \tabularnewline
\hline
8  & Wearer gains \textit{freedom of movement }\tabularnewline
\hline
9  & Wearer gains +5 resistance bonus on saving throws \tabularnewline
\hline
10  & Wearer may select which facet is active \tabularnewline
\hline
\end{tabular}

\vspace{12pt}
The wearer of the \textit{Ring }can, with a great deal of mental exertion, attempt 
to change the active facet away from one he or she does not desire. This requires 
a full-round action and a Concentration check (DC 50), and deals 2d6 points of 
nonlethal damage regardless of success. If the save is successful, the new facet 
is determined randomly. If the \textit{Ring }is removed, the former wearer takes 
2d6 points of nonlethal damage each minute until it is replaced or until his or 
her nonlethal damage exceeds his or her current hit points (though the nonlethal 
damage resumes again immediately when the former wearer regains consciousness).
